#### <a name="ypc"> Young Professional's Congress

Jose Reyes: NuScale has potential to be larger than Fluor is today

Eric Loewen:
- know yourself, your job, your people
- delegate specifically and follow up: enable people's creativity and indicate that the job is important
- read newspapers every day to know the larger context of the world (with enews concerns about having a wide enough distribution of ideas) WSJ, Financial times, NYT; read nuclear news; read books for diversity (Emma, Hunting for Quarks) - 1 non-fiction book per month (audiobooks count)
- grief: sequence death, out of sequence death, chronic death, accident. As a peer, cards, flowers, etc. Boss you need to ensure employee can navigate the system at work.
- one wish: continue to develop this technology. Convert the world from chemists to physicists. [keeton should go work for eric at GE].

Communication panel

Mimi:
- people remember things in 3s: each can stand alone, they compliment one another, they look to the future

----------------------------------------------------
PDC Workshop
- At meeting with president on Sunday at 9am, only share crucial needs or updates - not general status (Ben and I decided this is likely a good place to mention the new paper awards).
- Website and folders: they sent all of the information about login and access to the division officers (not to other committee members; lots of information is included.
- Also an update that divisions are all being transferred to the new consistently-formatted website model.
- Public Policy statements (Steve Nesbit): many of our current statements on the website are out of date and some are irrelevant. The PPC is doing a systematic review and requesting division help for getting things in better shape. YMG doesn't have any.
- Ray Klann standard meeting update. Some information about the 1-day speaker comp invitation that can be used by any division. Idea: can we use the 1-day complimentary as a partial credit for full meeting? Maybe some way to do this? Could be really helpful and encourage fuller meeting participation. Seems really valuable.

#### <a name="meetings"> Meetings

MCD Ex Comm:
- put together a blurb about the Gelbard scholarship for the newsletter and website
- idea generation for how to offer something to members that isn't meetings. What does MCD have to offer besides topicals and technical tracks? What can we do? 
- goal: improve relationship with NISD and THD; Tunc will point with NISD and Jeff Densmore will point with THD. We can go to their meetings, we can organize special topics panels. Some sort of multiphysics panel? We had some of these kinds of things at M&C; can we do this also at national meetings? Data management, visualization are other ideas...
- is benchmarks subcommittee still active? Had some joint with other committees - what happened to those?
- get a copy of the Bylaws and Rules for MCD
- setting up and getting rid of standing committees and special committees. We may need to change rules (R18.9.2 in society bylaws and rules): to change our rules we just need to submit changes to BRC for approval; need to check our bylaws and rules for the procedure.

RPSD Ex Comm:
- note to pay attention to the budget. We're running a deficit and need to pay attention to how that ballances with topical income - do this conscienscously. 
- consider embedding rpsd topical at a june meeting - offer of reward from the society. Issue with labs not getting more travel spots, so how might that impact rpsd attendance. Ray mentioned that travel restrictions might loosen? 
- make sure to check out call for innovations on the UW conference website.
- (make sure Kalin understands the directions we're giving them about the awards)

#### <a name="ypc"> Young Professional's Congress

Jose Reyes: NuScale has potential to be larger than Fluor is today

Eric Loewen:
- know yourself, your job, your people
- delegate specifically and follow up: enable people's creativity and indicate that the job is important
- read newspapers every day to know the larger context of the world (with enews concerns about having a wide enough distribution of ideas) WSJ, Financial times, NYT; read nuclear news; read books for diversity (Emma, Hunting for Quarks) - 1 non-fiction book per month (audiobooks count)
- grief: sequence death, out of sequence death, chronic death, accident. As a peer, cards, flowers, etc. Boss you need to ensure employee can navigate the system at work.
- one wish: continue to develop this technology. Convert the world from chemists to physicists. [keeton should go work for eric at GE].

Communication panel

Mimi:
- people remember things in 3s: each can stand alone, they compliment one another, they look to the future

PDC Workshop
- At meeting with president on Sunday at 9am, only share crucial needs or updates - not general status (Ben and I decided this is likely a good place to mention the new paper awards).
- Website and folders: they sent all of the information about login and access to the division officers (not to other committee members; lots of information is included.
- Also an update that divisions are all being transferred to the new consistently-formatted website model.
- Public Policy statements (Steve Nesbit): many of our current statements on the website are out of date and some are irrelevant. The PPC is doing a systematic review and requesting division help for getting things in better shape. YMG doesn't have any.
- Ray Klann standard meeting update. Some information about the 1-day speaker comp invitation that can be used by any division. Idea: can we use the 1-day complimentary as a partial credit for full meeting? Maybe some way to do this? Could be really helpful and encourage fuller meeting participation. Seems really valuable.

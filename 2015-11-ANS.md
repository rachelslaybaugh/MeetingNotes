#### <a name="ypc"> Young Professional's Congress

Jose Reyes: NuScale has potential to be larger than Fluor is today

Eric Loewen:
- know yourself, your job, your people
- delegate specifically and follow up: enable people's creativity and indicate that the job is important
- read newspapers every day to know the larger context of the world (with enews concerns about having a wide enough distribution of ideas) WSJ, Financial times, NYT; read nuclear news; read books for diversity (Emma, Hunting for Quarks) - 1 non-fiction book per month (audiobooks count)
- grief: sequence death, out of sequence death, chronic death, accident. As a peer, cards, flowers, etc. Boss you need to ensure employee can navigate the system at work.
- one wish: continue to develop this technology. Convert the world from chemists to physicists. [keeton should go work for eric at GE].

Communication panel

Mimi:
- people remember things in 3s: each can stand alone, they compliment one another, they look to the future

----------------------------------------------------
PDC Workshop
- At meeting with president on Sunday at 9am, only share crucial needs or updates - not general status (Ben and I decided this is likely a good place to mention the new paper awards).
- Website and folders: they sent all of the information about login and access to the division officers (not to other committee members; lots of information is included.
- Also an update that divisions are all being transferred to the new consistently-formatted website model.
- Public Policy statements (Steve Nesbit): many of our current statements on the website are out of date and some are irrelevant. The PPC is doing a systematic review and requesting division help for getting things in better shape. YMG doesn't have any.
- Ray Klann standard meeting update. Some information about the 1-day speaker comp invitation that can be used by any division. Idea: can we use the 1-day complimentary as a partial credit for full meeting? Maybe some way to do this? Could be really helpful and encourage fuller meeting participation. Seems really valuable.

#### <a name="meetings"> Meetings

MCD Ex Comm:
- [**AI**] put together a blurb about the Gelbard scholarship for the newsletter and website
- idea generation for how to offer something to members that isn't meetings. What does MCD have to offer besides topicals and technical tracks? What can we do? 
- goal: improve relationship with NISD and THD; Tunc will point with NISD and Jeff Densmore will point with THD. We can go to their meetings, we can organize special topics panels. Some sort of multiphysics panel? We had some of these kinds of things at M&C; can we do this also at national meetings? Data management, visualization are other ideas...
- is benchmarks subcommittee still active? Had some joint with other committees - what happened to those?
- {**AI**] get a copy of the Bylaws and Rules for MCD
- setting up and getting rid of standing committees and special committees. We may need to change rules (R18.9.2 in society bylaws and rules): to change our rules we just need to submit changes to BRC for approval; need to check our bylaws and rules for the procedure.

RPSD Ex Comm:
- note to pay attention to the budget. We're running a deficit and need to pay attention to how that balances with topical income - do this conscientiously. 
- consider embedding rpsd topical at a june meeting - offer of reward from the society. Issue with labs not getting more travel spots, so how might that impact rpsd attendance. Ray mentioned that travel restrictions might loosen? 
- make sure to check out call for innovations on the UW conference website.
- [**AI**] (make sure Kalin understands the directions we're giving them about the awards)

#### <a name="mon"> Monday, 11/9

YMG
- [**AI**] YMG and MCD co-sponsoring codes panel for the student conference at Madison
- [**AI**] I am helping interface with PDC and NPC to get the new best paper award rolled out and have participation. Follow up on that. (Katy will help).
- [**AI**] Twitter and FB thing. See if any UCB students want to do this - could be a good promo.

MCD panel
- Doug Kothe: exascale prospects for nuclear energy (get a copy of the slides?)
  - motivation: licensing, uprates, flexible operations, addicent tolerant fuel, margin, advanced design, fuel cycle, used fuel disposition
  - already our software can't exploit the hardware very well...(on petascale). With MOC or MC we're doing really well neutronically. 1T particle calcs in 4-5 hours are now possible. CFD we can use for calibration. 
  - Some info about what we could do at the exascale. Predictive load suliations. We can't do UQ on large systems right now. 
  - tera/peta/exascale comparison of what the roles will be. 
  - national strategic computing initiative: go see overall objectives online.3 agencies are lead here: DOE, DOD, NSF. Decade long project, being planned right now. Doug is involved in the application planning. 2 exacscale machines by 2023, one at nnsa one at office of science, hardware investment, software (compilers and middle ware), also applications. 
  - now can be writing a white paper for applications at exascale
  - in DOE 9 program office have areas in here. Only 6 or 7 NE responses. Several proposals: full core coupled MC neutronic-thermal hydraulic; LEW of a full core; lots of neutronics stuff in there.

- Andrew Siegel: Next-generation HPC and Nuclear Applications
  - MC tally memory: 1Tb of data for one statepoint with detailed simulation. Need efficient decomposition methods that are fast enough
  - MC cross section memory: realistic calcs, we need something like 100Gb, really have to figure out how to do this properly. (could there be ways to translate what we're learning on GPUs to regular calculations?).
  - MC tracking rate: either way, it takes to long to track all of these particles. 
  - [see about working with Paul and Andy through ANL...]
  - There are lots of CFD problems that fit into this research as well (distinction of real challenges, not one we made up to get money :))
  - 5 key areas: strong scaling and low latency communication (figuring out how to feed these things properly - limits of GPUs, etc.); FLOPs-intensive mathematical formulations (does this make MOC better than MC?); pliant algorithms for noisy processors (realizing that there ends up being load imbalance in the hardware, so load balancing your work may not really work out anyway - what do we do about that?); programming model abstractions for many-core (how do we really get the right program abstractions to help application developers create programs that can port to different architectures reasonably?); complex memory hierarchies (really getting more sophisticated about this; be really flexible about your algorithm and figure out how to map properly)

- Randy Baker: An SN Algorithm for Modern Architectures
  - major current challenges: mean job time interrupt increases super-linearly as node count increases; power bill - need more work on a given node
  - memory bandwidth is now the limiting factor. Need to minimize data movement and maximize independent work units.
  - it took them 1.5 person-years to port kba sweeps to roadrunner. b/c of that work it took 1 week to port to knc
  - best quote: "if you want to do something called FLOPs, you need something called data"
  - unanswered questions: use KNL high bandwidth memory as cache or user memory? How will we take advantage of increasingly heterogeneous machine architectures? As machines become more asynchronous, so much our algorithms and software.

- George Xu: The ARCHER Monte Carlo Code Involving CPU/GPU/MIC
  - have some results with a few different architectures. It would be good to learn more about their algorithms. They have GPU-CPU-MIC combo?
  - two performance challenges for GPUs: register usage reduces concurrent threads (more complex MC codes = more usages = fewer concurrent); branching code reduces performance (GPUs use SIMT, complex MC = more branching)
  - MICs: good: existing codes can be recompiled to run on MICs; bad: KNC are based on old CPU cores prone to memory stall, software-based prefetch may be helpful - though bad on GPU); Ugly: 512-bit SIMD registers permit ~1T flop in theory, few vectorization opportunities in practice
  - CUDA compiler can't currently optimize across files. Some other notes of interest? I zoned out...

SSC
- student conference proposal timeline: solid. good layout of details, reasons, transition, and implementation.
- [**AI**] nominate Brett for the YMG support award thing
- [**AI**] Tell UCB about new certificate of distinction process. need an additional form about outreach stuff now.
- (totally missed the annual report update - find out about that)
- outreach: promote national nuclear science week when you do outreach (or something?)
- [**AI**] Send Alexis scholarship info. Get Alexis to keep scholarship information as a standing item on the agenda. Also, do we still make the sheet with suggested sessions? That would be helpful to send out.
- [**AI**] rec to membership to make a need-based membership fees exception for students

PDC
- the collaborate site is not like dropbox nor googledocs. It is like sharepoint more. You have to download docs and the reupload if you want to share changes. It would be great to get something more collaborative
(real question: why can't we use some sort of google-contracted system?)
- website issues, talk to Linda Zec: lzec@ans.org
- again, pointing out that pdc website has a bunch of documents that are useful for figuring out how divisions work and for new officers
- need divisions to figure out what on your website is up to date and what is outdated.
- idea: give read access to everyone to archive folders; write access to division officers only. Option for protected folders. Why did they make both this collaborate and archive?
- subcommittee to talk about how to collaborate division websites, collaborate, and archive to all work together.
- the society spent $1M on ANS Collaborate.
- we need to train the more experienced members on how to use technology. 
- trying to get student members to convert to full members and retain current members. 
- [**AI**] Darby: roll out spend policy to divisions (they don't know about it); get them all of the reports. (division chairs, vice chairs, and treasurers--all officers)

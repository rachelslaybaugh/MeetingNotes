### <a name="day-20150527">Day 1: 2015/05/27 

(arrived only for the afternoon session)

#### Session 2a: Energy and Other Applications

1) *Nuclear Data Needs for Understanding Material Damage*, Patrick Griffin, SNL

  - uncertainties in data are a real problem
  - list of problem isotopes  
  - dosimetry needs perspective; endf types of problems
  - fusion community needing data up to 60 MeV
  - what is IRDFF community? 

2) *Challenges and Successes in Application of the Evaluated Nuclear Data Libraries for the Missouri University Research Reactor Core Irradiation Simulations*, Nickie Peters, UM Reactor Research Center 

  - they have a very detailed model of their core, with it they can get very accurate predictions of things like critical rod positions, excess core reactivity, etc.
  - they use NJOY for xsecs
  - transport with MCNP, ORIGEN, MONTEBURNS
  - isotope production prediction with similar tools
  - they have critical rod search software that they built themselves (based on repeated MCNP KCODE calculations)
  - two publications about the isotopes where they predict specific production rates to experimental; good for many but totally off for two
  - potential mismatch issues come from not fully knowing temp of samples, so modeling of broadening is not captured
  - need to selectively pick data sets for individual isotopes


#### Session 2b: Capabilities Part 1

1) *LBNL Lab Facility Review*, Larry Phair

  - 88 inch cyclotron: 
    - high intesity light ions (protons to 55  MeV, He-3 to 170 MeV)
    - heavy ions (5 to 32 MeV/nucleon, 0.2 - 0.5 Q/M) 
  - BASE (Berkeley Accelerator Space Effects): support national security and other US space gprorams in the areas of radiation effects testing; protons 1-55 MeV; mimics cosmic ray damange
  - BASE also has cocktails: can get tailored thing b/c they inject multiple ions that can be injected all at one time. This allows them to extract certain frequencies. Look at LET that cause failures in things
  - a bunch of different ion sources used in these things (I am not sure if BASE is something different or goes into the 88 inch)
  - ECR is a group that does something with ion sources
  - overview of where they are and where they could go (none of this stuff means really anything to me)
   - however, need good shielding calculations - so it might be worthwhile for me to learn some of this stuff.

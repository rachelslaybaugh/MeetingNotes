* General:
  - Pay attention to priorities and goals. If your idea can fit into it just explain it and that is fine.
  - Goal: exciting, compelling, important research ideas that are well-conceived and planned.
  - Research needs to have a positive impact in the world; look up Napolitano quotes.
  - $7M in this competition, up to 3 years, start 1/1/16
  - One-time opportunity to "catalyze" President's Key Systemwide Research Goals
  - Innovative Scholarship: significant, novel contributions to knowledge, science, or scholarship
 - Compelling topics that have the potential to improve lives, etc. (buzzword heavy)

* Priorities (there's an FAQ that gives lots of info on these things)
  1. Catalyze multicampus, systemwide collaboration (systemwide impact and benefit)
    - position UC as a national leader
    - leverage systemwide resources (use special facilities and infrastructure)
    - promote interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary
    - strong collaboration
  2. Catalyze public engagement (engage and benefit CA communities) [FAQs]
    - engage CA public in UC research mission
    - community collaboration/participation; citizen science; community outreach and problem-solving; K-12 education; others
  3. Catalyze faculty collaboration across career stages (faculty leadership and mentorship opportunities) [FAQs]
    - strong collaboration; professional advancement and retention
    - not just ladder-rank faculty (other schools, research scientists at labs, all eligible)
  4. Catalyze graduate student training opportunities [Quality of graduate student training]
    - engage meaningfully; gain professional experience; supports progress toward degree
  5. Catalyze undergraduate participation in research (Contributions to undergraduate education or curriculum)
    - educational, curricular or training/internship components
    - research activities inform or transform curriculum

* Other considerations (only the last one may be considered during loi):
  - proposed budgets need to be appropriate (to accomplish goal + impact) and judicious (ask for what you need) - do not just make a "fat" proposal, be strategic and justify it.
  - extramural leveraged funding likelihood (complimentary or next-stage - bring recognition to UC system) and sustainability plan (kickstart a longterm project and how you will keep going; or just be done in 3 years)
  - campus commitment and administrative capacity (need to show that there is sufficient capacity to do the project)
  - regulatory compliance barriers (if any) [not sure that this would apply to us other than saying we can get software licenses or something; a bonus since it will help us get moving quickly compared to some other types of projects]
  - relationship to existing collaborations and other support (not ongoing or continuing for existing things; can build on something existing but must take it in a new, compelling direction) 

* Who can apply
  - Lead must be UC campus academic appointee with PI status
  - minimum 3 total collaborating UC campuses (with co-PI site leads)
  - Additional systemwide collaborators as appropriate (other campuses, national labs with UC, other UC research entities)

* LOI: will approve either $25M worth or 30 at most to have the success rate be relatively high - more rigorous than past ones they do so people don't sink tons of time on the full proposal
  - submit on proposalCENTRAL, identify PI and Site Leads
  - project scope, proposed title, and thematic/disciplinary areas
  - total estimated budget

  - Abstract: 
    - research topic/scope summary (what will you do?)
    - significance, impact, contribution (why do they care?)

  - Questions: approach to collaboration components
    - multicampus structure and participation
    - some other things

* LOI tips: follow the rules; use the templates and follow limits; avoid jargon (target very broad audience, not specialists, people who are about research but don't know yours); nothing will be accepted late (noon PDT, Thursday, June 4).

* Other details: 
  - Notification in early July (10th at latest), only invited LOIs will get access to the materials. 
  - LOI is binding for topic and scope, but fill elaboration of the plan allows for some deviation. 
  - Log in to the proposalCENTRAL, get the directions, and fill in the 13 sections. -> You will get a confirmation email.
  - Slides will be posted online; they will post updates on the website (especially the faq).

* Questions/answers:
  - no required structure of the faculty collaboration
  - only 1 PI from each site (1 lead and 2 co-PIs), other personnel who are making significant contributions can be co-investigators (co-Is have no limit)
  - look at webpage for areas of strategic importance: can UC make a meaningful difference by having a multicampus collaboration in this area
  - You can collaborate with entities outside UC system if they have their own funding and tangibly contribute to the project; but that is not the goal of this (if there's some sort of thing someone else provides that is not available here you can add them).

### <a name"RFP">Notes on RFP and FAQ
Things to catalyze: Innovative scholarship, Multicampus and systemwide collaboration, Graduate student training opportunities, Faculty collaboration across career states, Public engagement in the UC research mission, Undergraduate participation in research.

LOI due Thursday, June 4 at noon pacific

LOI decision by Friday, July 10 (~25 will be invited, no feedback will be provided)

Full proposals due Wednesday, Aug. 26 (no more than 10 will be selected)


* Faculty collaboration: full proposals must articulate how the collaboration, mentorship, and shared leadership opportunities will be integrated into the proposed project and activities.
* Post doc opportunities are encouraged but not required.
* Medical care at the UC medical centers does not count as public engagement.
* Education and outreach to communities not already benefitting from healthcare delivery in the proposed research area may be considered as public engagement.
* Goal is new projects that will position UC as a leader, attract extramural funding, recruit and retain outstanding faculty, enhance education and training, and positively impact lives and society in CA, the nation, and the world. 
* Funding cannot be used for existing projects, core activities, or extending existing activities. 
* Everyone must disclose current and concurrent UCOP funding.
* A budget itemization and justification required only with full proposal.
* Funds may not be used to cover patient care costs, clinical trials, patent execution costs, fundraising costs, subawards to non-UC-affiliated entities (except for community engagement), or indirect costs. 

Useful notes from the FAQ:
* Public/community engagement: 
  - The most effective and meaningful activities will be those that are well-integrated into, and strengthen the quality of, the research effort while also advancing the educaton and service missions of the University.
  - They list some examples, what follows are a few relevant ones
     - Engaging communities in after-school resarch-enhanced enrichment opportunities
     - Education and outreach opportunities connecting the CA public to something with research relevance (they say museums, etc., but we could have something else).
     - Activities aimed at engaging new, hard-to-reach, or underserved populations in research-informed community benefit.

### <a name"LOI">Notes on LOI

Things we need to include beyond identifying information:
* primary research field(s) and interdisciplinary area(s)
* abstract (2400 characters / 350 words)
* brief text responses for structural components and eligibility criteria
* total budget and award term
* disclosure of current/concurrent ucop funding

Will be evaluated for responsiveness in 3 areas:
  1. Elligibility (did you follow the rules? do not add anything extra.)
  2. Research scope (is the topic compelling, innovative, and likely to create new knowledge or outcomes that benefit CA and the world in areas of strategic importance to UC?)
  3. Required components (are you catalyzing all the things?)

NOTE: communicating to non-experts in the field.

### <a name="plan">Our Plan

* PI: Rachel Slaybaugh (assist. prof., UCB-NE)
* co-PI: Nils Gronbech Jensen (full prof., UCD-materials)
* co-PI: Someone from UCSF-medical, TBD
* co-I: Peter Hosemann (assoc.prof., UCB-NE)
* co-I: Max Fratoni (assist. prof., UCB-NE)
* co-I: someone from UCD-physics? someone from UCSF-medical?
* consultants (correct term?): 
  - LANL IPF, Hong Back
  - LBL isotope production, Jim O'Neil
  - McClellan research reactor, Micheal Lerche (or someone else, I think he's leaving?)
  - Lee Bernstein (full adjunct prof., UCB-NE + LBL + LLNL)

Main idea: use a proton cyclotron for isotope production. 
We will design and experiment on targets to make isotopes that are badly needed for medical purposes. 
The end goal is to have a cyclotron that can fit in a truck and travel to sites as needed. 
This would have a large health impact in CA immediately and, if successful, would present opportunities for commercialization to have a global impact. 

The research that comes out of this has a strong chance of gaining additional funding (NIH, DOE, NSF, DHS, etc.) after the machine is acquired, the relationships are built, and initial research is conducted. 
The possibility of commercialization would also bring in funds that could be used to support research activities. 
If successful, this would also bring important recognition to UC and its capabilities.

The personnel are in a variety of career stages and many of them have never collaborated before. 
This is truly building new relationships with rich mentoring opportunities and brand new research opportunities. 
A few people have relationships from past research, so there is sufficient experience to ensure success.  

Graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be involved in this research. 
This is a unique opportunity to do research that has a combination of design, simulation, and experiment and that is also interdisciplinary. 
Each university will bring a different department with a different viewpoint. 
The students will get to interact with the researchers from each department, providing a unique crosscutting opportunity. 

As an extension, the cyclotron can be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate laboratory courses, enriching the curricula of both.
The machine will also be available for other research projects, creating deep and lasting opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and post docs alike.

A bonus impact is the relationship with LBL and LANL. 
The students will have the opportunity to interact with these consultants, which could lead to job opportunities in the long run.

(if  McClellan) A further bonus is the addition to the mission of the McClellan research reactor. 
This is a unique and valuable facility that has recently experienced some challenges. 
Identifying key ways that it can contribute to innovative research helps ensure the UC system maintains this valuable resource. 

(We will need to beef up ideas about public engagement): Prof. Slaybaugh is adding a math and science tutoring initiative within an existing non profit in West Oakland whose mission is community development (tentative but likely).
The students in the tutoring program could come to campus to visit the new cyclotron and learn about medical isotopes and health, materials science, modeling and simulation, nuclear physics, etc. 
This initiative could provide funding for a shuttle to and from campus and box lunches. 
If this is successful we could seek other funds or use funds from within the non profit. 

Another idea for outreach could be a broader community education effort about medical isotopes. 
This can be focused around awareness about UC's research, cancer treatment and medical therapies, how technology from other fields enhances medicine, etc.

#### Budget
* May include direct costs only (maybe that makes all of these figures lower?).
* UC-managed labs must waive their indirect cost recovery. 
* Indirect costs can be covered by matching funds from non-UC sources or cost-sharing by the labs or other entities. 


(the dream funding:)
* cyclotron: ~$150k
* 3 graduate students for 3 years ($60k*3*3 = $540k)
* 1 post doc for 3 years ($80k*3 = $240k)
* funding for 3 undergraduate researchers for 3 years ($12/hr * 10 hrs/wk * 40 wk/yr * 3 yr * 3 students = $43k) 
* 1 month summer salary for 3 PIs for 3 years ($130k?)
* 0.5 month summer salary for 2-4 co-Is for 3 years ($65k?)
* outreach: $25k

total: ~$1.2M 

(May be too much? We will need firmer estimates on all of this and to really thing through what we need.)



-----------------------------------
### <a name="full">Full Proposal
(quick notes for planning LOI)

11 page max, excluding abstract, budget justification, and attachments.
Will include:

* abstract/summary
* proposed activities (6 pages)
* collaboration, mentorship, and training opportunities (2 pages)
* systemwide engagement and benefit (1 page)
* public engagement and research benefit (1 page)
* timeframe, milestones, and evaluation metrics (1 page)

Discussion of evaluation criteria pages 7-8: good to read when crafting LOI abstract.

5 extra areas are 
- appropriateness of budget
- plans to secure extramural funding
- other sources of support (this needs to be new and distinct)
- sufficient campus commitment and adminitrative capacity
- if we have human subjects or toxic substances: how we will address regulatory compliance.

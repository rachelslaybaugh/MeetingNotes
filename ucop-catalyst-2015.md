***

* Pay attention to priorities and goals. If your idea can fit into it just explain it and that is fine.
* Goal: exciting, compelling, important research ideas that are well-conceived and planned.
* Research needs to have a positive impact in the world; look up Napolitano quotes.

* $7M in this competition, up to 3 years, start 1/1/16
* One-time opportunity to "catalyze" President's Key Systemwide Research Goals
* Innovative Scholarship: significant, novel contributions to knowledge, science, or scholarship
* Compelling topics that have the potential to improve lives, etc. (buzzword heavy)

* Priorities (there's an FAQ that gives lots of info on these things)
  1. Catalyze multicampus, systemwide collaboration (systemwide impact and benefit)
    - position UC as a national leader
    - leverage systemwide resources (use special facilities and infrastructure)
    - promote interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary
    - strong collaboration
  2. Catalyze public engagement (engage and benefit CA communities) [FAQs]
    - engage CA public in UC research mission
    - community collaboration/participation; citizen science; community outreach and problem-solving; K-12 education; others
  3. Catalyze faculty collaboration across career stages (faculty leadership and mentorship opportunities) [FAQs]
    - strong collaboration; professional advancement and retention
    - not just ladder-rank faculty (other schools, research scientists at labs, all eligible)
  4. Catalyze graduate student training opportunities [Quality of graduate student training]
    - engage meaningfully; gain professional experience; supports progress toward degree
  5. Catalyze undergraduate participation in research (Contributions to undergraduate education or curriculum)
    - educational, curricular or training/internship components
    - research activities inform or transform curriculum

* Other considerations (only the last one may be considered during loi):
  - proposed budgets need to be appropriate (to accomplish goal + impact) and judicious (ask for what you need) - do not just make a "fat" proposal, be strategic and justify it.
  - extramural leveraged funding likelihood (complimentary or next-stage - bring recognition to UC system) and sustainability plan (kickstart a longterm project and how you will keep going; or just be done in 3 years)
  - campus commitment and administrative capacity (need to show that there is sufficient capacity to do the project)
  - regulatory compliance barriers (if any) [not sure that this would apply to us other than saying we can get software licenses or something; a bonus since it will help us get moving quickly compared to some other types of projects]
  - relationship to existing collaborations and other support (not ongoing or continuing for existing things; can build on something existing but must take it in a new, compelling direction) 

* Who can apply
  - Lead must be UC campus academic appointee with PI status
  - minimum 3 total collaborating UC campuses (with co-PI site leads)
  - Additional systemwide collaborators as appropriate (other campuses, national labs with UC, other UC research entities)

* LOI: will approve either $25M worth or 30 at most to have the success rate be relatively high - more rigorous than past ones they do so people don't sink tons of time on the full proposal
  - submit on proposalCENTRAL, identify PI and Site Leads
  - project scope, proposed title, and thematic/disciplinary areas
  - total estimated budget

  - Abstract: 
    - research topic/scope summary (what will you do?)
    - significance, impact, contribution (why do they care?)
  - Questions: approach to collaboration components
    - multicampus structure and participation
    - some other things

* LOI tips: follow the rules; use the templates and follow limits; avoid jargon (target very broad audience, not specialists, people who are about research but don't know yours); nothing will be accepted late (noon PDT, Thursday, June 4).

* Notification in early July (10th at latest), only invited LOIs will get access to the materials. 
* LOI is binding for topic and scope, but fill elaboration of the plan allows for some deviation. 
* Log in to the proposalCENTRAL, get the directions, and fill in the 13 sections. -> You will get a confirmation email.

* Slides will be posted online; they will post updates on the website (especially the faq).

* Questions/answers:
  - no required structure of the faculty collaboration
  - only 1 PI from each site (1 lead and 2 co-PIs), other personnel who are making significant contributions can be co-investigators (co-Is have no limit)
  - look at webpage for areas of strategic importance: can UC make a meaningful difference by having a multicampus collaboration in this area
  - You can collaborate with entities outside UC system if they have their own funding and tangibly contribute to the project; but that's not the goal of this (if there's some sort of thing someone else provides that is not available here you can add them).

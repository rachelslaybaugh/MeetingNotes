#### <a name="ballard"> Parallel Tensor Compression for Large-Scale Scientific Dat

- was not taking notes yet, but this looked super interesting
- get slides

#### <a name="benson"> Network clustering with higher-order structures

- Two fundamental graph analyses: real-world networks have modular organizeaiton, 
- unifies themes and uses clustering for higher order information
- motif-based clustering by generalizing spectral clustering
- conductance -> spectral clustering -> pretty clear slides
- I don't think about graphs much, so I'm not too familiar with any of this stuff.

#### <a name="carson"> Communication-Avoiding Krylov Methods in Theory and Practice

- algos have 2 costs: communication and computation. Moving data is between levels of memory hierarchy and processors
- over time, memory and interconnect latency and interconnect bandwidth are not improving: barriers to exascale
- Krylov subspace methods
- communication: add dimension to K_m is a sparse mat-vec mult, parallel: comm vec entries w neighbors; orthogonalize requires inner products, in parallel global reduce 
- get slides for this, could be useful
- went thru how this maps to cg
- ideaL compute blocks of s iterations at once to reduce communication cost by O(s) - idea that has been frequently rediscovered
- resurgence of interest in recent years b/c of prob size and comm cost
- basically moving work from message passing to flops and words moved - so can be a win depending on machine
- can auto-tune to find the best s (degree of unrolling)
- however, s will also impact convergence rate and accuracy
- theoretically the same (Krylov and comm-avoiding Krylov); issue with finite precision
- can get a bound
- use residual replacement strategy (update with true), but only do it sometimes
- use Paige's Lanczos convergence analysis as a starting point for their convergence analysis
- also look at work by Greenbaum to look at eigenvalue precision.
- may be promising...could be something to look into? Maybe it would fix my mg method? That thing is soooo sloooow

#### <a name="henry"> Software Design for Small Matrices

- idea of setting a flag to do JIT optimization for really small things that you do a whole bunch of times
- based loosely on libxsmm, which is currently on github
- (also mlk_direct_call)
- the compiler can't beat a really smart person writing assembly. 
- this is for small mat-mat mult
- there are two other options besides compiler flag: manually get routines for best performance or utilities that create static kernels for the user

#### <a name="bilmes"> A PHiPAC Retrospective

- retrospective, in honor of back to the future day?
- 1990s; Gaussian mix Hidden Markov Models, neural networks (Multi-Layerd Perceptions) were unpopular (compute intense mat-vec or mat-mat mult
- used hand-tuned mat-mult: not very efficient
- also used vendor-supplied libraries, but they were very expensive and very non-portable (also 3-nested loops, but who does that?)
- had horrible c macros, realized they could write code generators also do search over many design points
- added a bunch of stuff to make it more sophisticated (loop unrolling, multiple cache hierarchy, better search, etc.)
- slides from 1997; very cs-ey (which I don't know at all)
- their '97 paper is now getting sighted because of the new complexity of neural networks that people are trying to simulate (very deep neural networks)
- look up deep dream ai imagines

#### <a name="garmired"> Application of Linear Algebra to Making

- lots of renewable energy, solar decathalon, other random stuff
- ilab: maker space at u hawaii
- made renewable energy monitor bots (1/10th cots cost)
- issues with 3D printing / making stuff because of lack of precise sensing
- this talk is a bit about integrating new technology that's become cheap enough to use: Kinect and depth sensors can map surfaces
- needs real-time image processing to figure out how to properly correct (computer vision)
- (currently you 3D scan objects that you want to print rather than as you're printing)
- algorithms needs some updating and the areas that are most needed are what we can handle least well with current tools and methods
- 3D printing with quad copters...all of the buzz ideas. All of them. 
- also building a rope bridge with flying machines. 
- 3D print things for teaching math; incorporate with 3D vis.

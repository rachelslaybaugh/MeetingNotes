#### <a name="intro">Introduction
*Jacopo Buongiorno*

Todreas started in the 1970s, retired 2005

focusing on economics and safety; easier to solve technically, much lower political component
**cost**: conventional approach isn't looking at the biggest piece
- most capital cost is in installation engineering and financing, not equipment; followed by financing costs and engineering costs
- modularity and pre-fab, building in shipyards, transportation in new ways that can be way better and cheaper, 
- automation and advanced robotics for maintenance and operation and security?

**market**: traditional is baseload and steady state
- in reality (esp with renewables) that stops working
- load following? can we couple to cheap storage? can we make useful coproducts?

**safety**: traditional focus on dba, training and emergency response, reduction of core damage frequency...
- reality, severe accidents = land contamination = public issue
- do we need new safety requirements? long-term passive safety; eliminate need for evacuation

MITEI is legit doing things. $600M mostly from industry; 1/3 of faculty participate
- new MITEI Low Carbon Energy Center (CANES is predecessor
- new future of nuclear energy in a carbon constrained world: Jacopo, Dave Betti, Corradini; lots of other folks as team members; also have fancy advisory board.

#### <a name="session1">Must Dos for Advanced Nuclear Power Plants
1. *John Deutch*
SEAB report: describe challenges that need to be overcome s.t. U.S. can ad 5-10 GWe / yr from 2030-2050
a. If U.S. does not adopt type of initiative in the report, there will be no nuclear in 20 years
b. brining any concept of nuclear power from here to FOAK will take 15 years and cost $10B 
c. any time someone mentions a new nuclear concept, ask for a rough outline of schedule and cost to get from here to FOAK

Challenges:
- overnight capital cost: right now nuclear is more expensive that solar (because of tax credit and assumes that it will continue); gas with social cost of GHG is cheapest 
- projected low natural gas cost: based on EIA estimate project low for 30 years
- market structure: no carbon pricing; RPS do not admit nuclear; base load generation is not properly valued. Many solutions possible, but we need market changes
- program structure: 4 phase program for an advanced reactor system
a. R&D, downselect
b. component development, RNC licensing
c. demonstration plant construction and operation (if needed)
d. construction of FOAK commercial plant
All of that will take 25 years, $11.5B and 50% public/private
- program management: create quasi-public corporation to manage the initiative funded through 1 time congressional appropriation
- safety & licensing: NRC has the authority to develop a staged approach for licensing of advanced reactors; more financial support is needed. 
- fuel cycle and waste management
- international linkages: we're continuing to lose influence, which has security and safety implications

Punchline: the road is not easy.


2. *John Parsons, MIT Sloan School of Management*
Confronting the Economic Challenge
- history: LWRs were expensive to build and not operated well = bad
- 2003 MIT future of nuclear report basically said nuclear might be cost competitive in regulated markets (deregulated, not cost competitive); said the costs could come down through O&M and construction costs
- EPAct 2005 reflected some of that (licensing procedure, etc.); doesn't seem to be working
- olkiluoto estimated 2005-2009 and 3B EUR; now: 2018? maybe only 9B EUR? Ugh.
- we have been accidentally reducing our carbon footprint b/c natural gas is cheap, but that won't work forever. We've been able to avoid the test. Globally, not as easy. Doing things here isn't enough, we need to make economic development make sense--and nuclear won't work unless we seriously change the cost.
- Really need: nuclear to be sexy to get the best and the brightest in it. It really is a talent challenge, an attitude challenge, and a perception challenge. 
- here: gas is cheaper and renewables have political power; abroad coal is cheaper
- no significant benefit financially from sorting out the fuel cycle
- innovative finance?


3. *Pete  Lyons*
Design, Safety, and Regulatory Options for Advanced Nuclear Reactors
- improve economics; reduced public concern over safety; public recognition of importance of carbon reductions; reducing nuclear waste; reducing regulatory burden
- if you're serious about deep decarbonization, electricity is definitely not enough. 
- passive safety: reduced EPZ, infinite coping times, smaller site footprint, lower staffing and less safety grade equipment
- high temperature operation: efficiency, process heat applications, hybrid energy systems (critical for low carbon future). Material issues are a major challenge in high temp
- Hybrid systems: nuclear and renewable synergies for deep decarbonization; conference about this recently--INL and NREL collab
- fast spectrum: (remains a question as to whether we need them and if/how well they'll work) 
  * good: Reuse of used fuel/transmutation. Economics may make closed system make sense eventually; may strategically use to reduce enrichment needs; may offer improved economics; improved resource utilization (which is not actually a problem); breeding can be viewed a lot of ways. 
  * challenges: licensing, collants, higher enrichment fuels, challenging control, not enough experience
- underground siting: reduce security issues, other benefits...
- dissolved fuel: (not sure about this one) 
  * good: very strong safety case; economic benefits(?); may simplify fuel fab and refueling and waste handling
  * challenges: licensing, on-line processing
  * need demo plant
- load following/ramping: helps with renewable integration, but seems wasteful. hybrid systems seem better
- SMRs: economics need to be proved but many potential benefits: smaller epz, the laundry list...
- thorium fuel: they get weekly proposals about how Th will save the world, and they keep coming in with studies about why it won't. It doesn't fix proliferation, we're not worried about resources and mining issues, new fuel cycle, new infrastructure, and new licensing a problem. Benefits aren't worth it yet
- low pressure coolant good possibility
- essential: economics, passive safety, high temp
- desirable: low pressure coolant, small size and modular, underground siting
- questionable: dissolved fuel, load following, fast spectrum, Th fuel 

*Q&A:*
- what's the breakdown of public spending for seab 4 part proposal: public big and early, private sustained and later
- new licensing for advanced needs to be risk informed (Kadak comment). Lyons says we need the new regulations to go forward, the also help with the funding challenge
- framework is totally U.S. centric; each contry has its own internal view that is like this and it's antiquated. Maybe we don't even fix the thing in the U.S. and we focus on global. I'm not sure the analogy to flatting of nuclear to computers b/c of the extra issues associated with nuclear. (really it's OECD compared to non-OECD)
- in a new world of electricity, maybe we supply a different part of the nuclear supply change that keeps us competitive and well-balanced in the game (similar to how it works in solar)?
- is there a role for advanced LWRs in this new future? maybe. it's the economics of safety that really matter right now. 
- have the panel make this assessment: someone else needs to figure it out. Deutch says rapid downselect. Jacopo says let the market select. He thinks there are more common crosscutting technologies that can improve across the board. Converse concern about endless R&D.

#### <a name="session2">Focus on Economics

1. *Jessica Lovering and How to Make Nuclear Cheap* 
- inherent safety
- technological readiness
- modularity
- efficiency

To figure some of this out, they wanted to look at historical cost data; which they had to generate themselves over 2 years of research. Just the tip of the iceberg; the dataset is available. The question: how did nuclear get so expensive?
- cost increases in France were slight and followed their general construction cost increases
- S. Korea is the only country that showed cost decrease. 

Questions about diseconomies of scale? 
- Too many factors to actually be able to make conclusions about that in the U.S. 
- France it's also hard to tell, looks a little like bigger = cheaper. 
- S. Korea does exhibit economies of scale. 
- Other countries: no clear trend. 

Probably about "right-sizing" than economies of scale. Big growing economies might still need large reactors; developed economies are more like to need 400/600 MW, etc.

Economies of scale (really economies of multiples) do work on site. 

Lesson from Boeing dreamliner: lots of R&D costs deeply focused on making it cheaper; had delays while globalizing supply chain. Had guaranteed orders. For us, is modular enough? No.


2. *Charles Forsberg, Designing Advanced NPPs*
(get slides: look at in detail; this is good stuff w/ lots of good ideas; talk to him)
- zero and negative pricing isn't good for anyone
- solar thermal plants working on heat storage systems so they're not selling free electricity at noon. Turns out, this works better with nuclear, so maybe we can capitalize on that. 
- different options are useful for different market needs
- salt coolants originally designed to couple reactors to jet engines
- topping cycles (indian point 1 had this; we can now do this with gas--design example with FHR)
- lots of ideas about buying cheap electricity and get it back on the grid when prices are higher. this flattens electricity prices and probably helps business. Big questions in efficiency of it all. Does it end up bad for overall impact and/or the consumer? Or, does this flattening allow more technologies to make sense for an overall win?

Basically: lots of cool ideas. Get slides. 


3. *Jake Jurewicz, Leveraging New Technologies to Reduce Costs*
(also get Jake's slides; more than he can cover, lots of good info)
- opportunity to rethink things; brainstorming and getting  lots of ideas out there. Yay for shaking it up!
- price of natural gas determines the wholesale price of electricity; this renewables thing is a distraction that is a second order effect. We must plan that it will stay cheap. 
- we have a ton of oil and natural gas reserves; we've stopped searching for more. 
- future: low nat gas, increased renewables, flat to negative load growth, interacting with smart grids, more engaged customers
- nuclear has to become the zero-emissions dispatchable electricity source
- we think a ton about the core; we need to change the rest of the plant, construction times, financing, O&M over time, decomissioning (which is increasing). Entire lifecycle of plants need to be considered. 
- look at slide 14
- software: analytics for near and long term optimizations. 
- hardware: sensors for all sorts of things. maybe also drones... robotics. 


*Q&A:*
- Andy Kadak brought up autonomous nuclear reactor designs (was brought up in arpa-e workshop). security force is bigger than O&M staff. We also need licensing cultural shift so the relationship is less adversarial. Jake likes this autonomous comparison. Nuclear weapons are typically not guarded by people.
- international opportunity? aircraft have global duopoly. It is likely nuclear will have the same? 
- request to not lose long-term R&D as a focus in the face of innovation and short term items. company R&D is in some ways increasing again, had gone down. 
- once students are here we need to balance teaching the fundamentals with dynamic interest and new things that are happening. It really is a balance.

#### <a name="session3">Advanced Reactor Technologies
1. *Bob Schleicher (GA), Can GFRs Meet the Challenge?*
- again, natural gas prices. 
- efficiency: high temp, direct cycle, reduced hotel load, high efficiency generator
- reduce overnight costs: (lost thos bullets)
- probably small: less frequent refueling, smaller site/less security, standardized components; reduce fuel costs
- technologies: long-burn core physics, SiC composites, fission product ventilation, high power conversion, asynchronous high-speed generators
- proliferation resistant spent fuel recycling. 
- some EM2 details, look in slides; I sort of zoned out. dracs. maybe it will be cheaper in 30 years?


2. *Lewis Lommers (Areva), HTGRs*
- high temp heat addresses key energy markets; the technology is nearly ready now; safety benefits
- (assumption: that it matters that low power density is bad)
- HTGRs have the potential to serve a lot of applications b/c of the high temperature. 
- cost benefit: high thermal efficiency (30% over LWRs), eliminates a bunch of safety systems, fuel utilization, process heat markets. 
- 600 MWth is the target size for modular units
- fundamental safety characteristics: ceramic core cannot melt, triso is robust, inert coolant, passive cooling, long system time constraints, negative reactivity feedback
- low investment risk: no design basis events, no events prevent plant restart, no real beyond design basis events, supported by detailed NRC review
- good job selling this and the concept. 
- Maybe the cost starts winning when you're integrating into a very complicated industrial process system that is incredibly expensive. Also safety is paramount in those cases. 
- next steps: complete design, licensing, FOAK demo (not tech demo, but really the finalizing step), design cert
- full commercial deployment in the 2030s


3. *Paolo Ferroni (W), Lead-cooled Fast Reactors*
- chose LFR to meet global commercialization needs based on safety, economics, and marketability. Second  level concerns were resource utilization, trl, etc. 
- T l.t. 500C to manage corrosion and still ~40% efficiency
- SMR size; proven materials (D9, SS3016) and UO2
- slide 10 has summary of items in the 3 areas of focus
- stating that it's actually more technology ready than generally thought. Basically there are already a bunch of test facilities that address most of the needs. 
- zoned out for end of talk details...


4. *Pavel Hejzlar (TP), TWR*
- breed and burn reactor require one time loading of fissile material, then NU. 
- 3000 MWt rxtr
- major challenges: fuel burnup is very high, (1st slide)
- solutions for: 
  - Na temp coeff: mechanical bonding, tight lattice to min amount of Na in core; max reliance on other neg rxtvity feedbacks
  - high min peak burnup: 
  - high cladding a duct peak dose:
- key issues to be resolved (slide 6)
- power and flow matching over core lifetime achieved by detailed shuffling and core orificing strategy. 
- and again, zoned out on details


5. *Joe Kowalcyzk, Southern's R&D*
- have a full time dedicated research staff; 60 people who do this as a full time job
- In the next 50 years we need to replace 50% of the generation capacity on our grid
- they chose: -fast- v thermal, breeder v -burner-, -liquid- v solid fuel, Th v -U-, coolant type: liquid salt (slides give good, simple explanation) 
- working with TP MCFR design
- have lots of partners who they're talking / working with


*Q&A*
- How do we integrate these new reactors into the landscape of existing LWRs? need to update licensing framework (yes, again). HTGR issue: assuming there's enough HEU to downblend right now, but for commercial fleet need to get the enrichment facilities changed and ready for 12-18%. Disposal of triso is also a thing that isn't really sorted out. 
- How to reduce the engineering costs? component shopping cart so that you can't just use lots of things that each require their own analysis, sourcing, etc. Might not optimize the efficiency, but will make things way simpler for scaling up or down and not making lots of extra work with low impact. Addressing Eric's comment yeterday as well.
- Downselection from Southern? They've picked a winner so far, but they're keeping some options open.

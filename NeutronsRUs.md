### Meeting: 2015/02/18
Ivana, Baghdad Atlas
* ORNL measured and published data in 1953, several species of radioactivants to
measure a spectrum that is used for reference in the Baghdad Atlas
* missed it, some description about that data in the context of the Baghdad data
* looks like Baghdad Atlas just used a simple hand calc (I = I_0 \exp_{-\sigma N x})
  for the plot 2 and a watt spectrum (sort of based on ORNL measurements).
* Empire is the best code that we have in terms of capturing knowledge.

Leo
* Experiment updates; getting info from Ka Leung

James
* Forenscis/radchem workshop last week - understanding what they can do at NIF
* 3 dedicated radchem shots are coming up.
* Possibility of riding along on the back of a dim during another experiment, 
  but you get lots of contamination from neihboring dim. Could that serve as a
  proof of principle? 
* Fission product distribution: TALYS was not helping - perhaps use Empire 
  instead. Using experimental data instead for now.
* Walid Younes starting a sabattical at LBNL, worth talking to him about this.

Austin
* building a proton recoil telescope that can measure stuff above ~1MeV.

Nmeka
* simulating x-ray production in HFNG using Geant4
* first without shroud, then with shroud

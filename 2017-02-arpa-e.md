### <a name="open">Opening
Eric kicked us off with a lot of comments about the real successes of ARPA-E.
Notably, $1.5B in gov't investment has led to $1.8B of private investment in 74
companies. Lots of good examples of individual projects.

Rafael Reif about the need for basic and applied science. Mostly just different
versions of that.

Ilan Gur gave a great overview of Cyclotron Road--how it has succeeded and why
we need more of them. It helps fill very early stage gaps for energy tech, sort
of in the first valley of death but not exactly even that. Mostly just what to
do about energy ideas that are too big for just university research and not
ready for VC funding (perhaps b/c of where VCs are). The challenge: how do we
build more of these types of programs? Where will the money come from?

### <a name="ml">Machine Learning in Energy
** Zico Kolter, CMU **
- train data, machine learning algorithm, auto generate a program, something else
- why now? (1) huge amounts of data (2) massive computation (3) advanced
  algorithms
- task-based, end-to-end learning

** Jim Gao, DeepMind **
- an Alphabet company, mission: solve intelligence; use it to make the world a
  better place
- use reinforcement learning
- taught their thing to play atari and go
- applications of this technology: maximize energy efficiency of data center
  cooling--need temperature and pressure constraints
- 1200 state variables and a collection of actions (flow, temperature, valve
  positions, etc.)
- this is able to do things we already know and is discovering new insights and
  ways to do things (honestly the true power of ML--seeing what humans can't)

** Max Hutchinson, Citrine Informatics **
- materials and manufacturing
- solar materials example: look at combination of properties
- * ML applied to nuclear data evaluation and processing? *
- citrine.io/blog
- also, searched for thermo electrics, looking at ZT
- majority of models for materials informatics is fine and work well, but there
  is still a big barrier in automation. How do we remove the human part and
  over specialization? They try to focus on getting good enough models
  everywhere rather than perfecting a few models.

** Sahika Genc, GE Global Research **
- (gencs@ge.com)
- industrial machine learning, gather 300 data pts/sec--trying to figure out how
  to collect and process huge amounts of data
- have had good experiences with engine optimization; similar with wind
  operation

All of these talks are sort of examples of the kinds of things that can be
accomplished, not much on how to do it. Punchline: there are a lot of ways we
can improve what we already have without many real changes (similar to power
uprates, reducing margin, etc.)

Discussion: 

How to implement? For data centers, robust safety net plus slow
integration. Started just by giving recommendations. As they proved successful,
eventually transitioned into automation. That is, staged integration approach
with checks and proofs.

What about when you know things about the problem? It sounds like there are ways
to break up the problem that let you do this. You can integrate systems (list of
things, explicit variable models), so there are ways in the literature to do
this. 

craziest application: all thermal stats are automated; closed loop something
something--coupling things with simulation. Max H might be good to talk to; what
about grid operation?; drones to inspect power lines (can charge on the grid
itself)

### <a name="fp1">Fast Pitches
** Joseph Rollin **: biogas based on learning from how cows work.

** Marc von Keitz **: H production from high temp thermochemical cracking. 
The goal, convert methane into H and CO2 instead. 
Looking at what to do with the CO2 that comes out of the process. Can put carbon
into solid form, which might be a good market. Making C nanotubes and then
carbon fiber. Really early stage, but some serious promise. Workshop in summer
'17. Looks super interesting. 

** Eric Schiff **: building-integrated solar power. Cool solar panels that are
achitecturally appealing are too expensive. There are also building-integrated
ideas that are sort of woven in (vs. building-applied, where you bolt things on
top). The integrated version has lots of advantages, but isn't yet cheap enough
yet. But, maybe. It could compete with slate roofs. Perhaps some other
applications (metal roofs?) might start making sense. 

** Jenni Gerbi **: what to do with buildings when they're unoccupied? They suck
up a ton of energy for no reason. Residential and Commercial HVAC is 13% of US
energy consumption. All we really need to know: are humans home yes/no? In
commercial buildings, need to know how many people are in which zone. Privacy is
a big concern in all of this. Better HVAC has a big impact on the productivity
of people, so this can actually have a big impact on one of the more expensive
costs of a company. A FOA is out, cool different aspects. Also, Jenni is
completely awesome.

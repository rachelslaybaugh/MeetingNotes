### <a name="day-20150602">Day 1: 2015/06/02 

Alain Lebrun, IAEA, *Technology Foresight for IAEA Safeguards Instrumentation*
- data evaluation tools
- data fusion from multiple sensors during inspector's field missions
- last page has links to useful resources

Sara Pozzi
- seems easier just to download the slides
- looks like a whole lot of capitalizing on stuff that was already happening

Robin Gardner
- simulation, analysis, and modeling (SAM); data fusion and analytic techniques (DFAT) are two thrust areas of interest to me (they have 4)
- really working to build and set up something new compared to CVT, which is doing what is already there

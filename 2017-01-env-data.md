Environmental Knowledgebase Workshop

Jan 21, 2017

UCB, BIDS

Objective: This one day workshop focuses on exploring and linking
Berkeley-based projects, expertise, advances and opportunities that could be
relevant to a future environmental knowledgebase.

### <a name="snap1">Snapshots Part 1
* Neil Davies – Moorea Project
  - ecology can work at the scale of the planet; huge amounts of very large
    data.
  - we also care about things at the human scale; all politics is local
  - how do we integrate large-scale changes to local impact?
  - we need to model both global scale _and_ local scale to see how they
    interact with one another. "genome up" and "planet down"
  - roadmap

* Susan Hubbard – Watershed Science (looks like a person I should talk to)
  - how do watersheds respond to perturbations in rainfall, etc.? How do we
    predict that?
  - how do you figure out the resolution needed? 
  - looking to predict aggregate behavior--using AMR and scale-adaptive
    strategy
  - data heterogeneity: multi-scale, multi-resolution
  - very hierarchically-nested measurements
  - wish list: anomaly detection and notification; image analysis
    assimilation; automatic synthesis. This is a good slide...
  - How do we really figure out what data we need to use out of the data we
    collect? How do we do that formally? Perturbation studies? Machine
    learning?
  - This project uses Broker Approach, which sorts through data and pulls out
    what it thinks are important

* Maggi Kelly – Drones & Historical Data
  - 21st century mapping toolkits for large humanitarian questions
  - *This* digitizing historical data, used holos eco engine (open API) to do this
  - *This* also taking old reports, scanning, using Watson Alchemy API, and bringing
    out the main components of those research items
  - they're taking new images and there is still this global / local challenge
  - big challenge in linguistics and text processing for getting out this old
    data
  - Raster Foundry

* Chris Mungall - Ontology Learning for Biosciences, Energy, and the Environment
  - fuse data and knoweldge to enable decision support for env and energy
  - different ontologies for classifying different types of data
    ([geneonotology.org](http://www.geneonotology.org),
     [environmentontology.org](http://www.environmentontology.org))
  - looking at automatically classifying data as it's being generated: combine
    data, databases, and literature information; combined knowledge systems
  - use the question you're asking to guide how much of which inputs you want

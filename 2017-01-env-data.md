### <a name="snap1">Snapshots Part 1
* Neil Davies – Moorea Project
  - ecology can work at the scale of the planet; huge amounts of very large
    data.
  - we also care about things at the human scale; all politics is local
  - how do we integrate large-scale changes to local impact?
  - we need to model both global scale _and_ local scale to see how they
    interact with one another. "genome up" and "planet down"
  - roadmap

* Susan Hubbard –Watershed Science


* Maggi Kelly – Drones & Historical Data

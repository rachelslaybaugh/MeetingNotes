### Day 2: 2015/03/25
* Eric Rauch, Used Fuel Cask Identification through Self-Interrogating Neutrons

    - (cask fingerprinting).
    - Get cask models from him?
    - Can we capitalize on what he is doing?

* Cari Launiere, Advances in Molten Salt Sampling

* Natalie Gese, Actinide Sensor and Voltametry Upate

* Gregory Galbreth, Level and Density Measurement of Molten Salts

* Laura Maggos, Mass Flow Models for Electrochemical Processing Safeguards

* Howard Menlove, Optimization of a Boron Based Neutron Detector for High Radiation Fields

* Larry Ticknor, Hybrid Statistical Testing for Nuclear Material Accounting and/or Process Monitoring Data in Nuclear Safeguards

### Day 2: 2015/03/26
* Mike Rabin, Microcalorimeter Update

    - Really focusing on improving counting statistics by removing systematics that prevent us getting under 1%. 
    - The idea is to take advantage of newer understanding.
    - Recognizing the idea that we can often measure ratios more accurately than the individual pieces. 
    - Breaking that down into intra-isotope and inter-isotope information. 
    - He thinks the intra values will be easier.

* Joel Ullom, Microwave Readout Techniques for Very Large Arrays of Nuclear Sensors

    - using RF squids that are helpful in cryogenic sensors. 
    - developed something new that can be used at warm temperatures.

* David Meier, The Multi-Isotope Process Monitor: Deployment at H Canyon FY 2015 Progress

* Lindsay Sexton, H Canyon Test Best Activities

    - motivation: full-scale testing of detectors for safeguards
    - objectives: engineering safeguards and nonprolif; 
    real-time snm accountability;
    env. monitoring and compliance; 
    improved process control
    - were able to identify Pu peaks
    - were able to find off-normal conditions
    - 5 different monitoring systems (UV0vis (micro cell), UV-vis (long path), HiRX, Air Sampling, another one) - implementation time depends on TRL and some H Canyon factors

* Chris Phillips, overview about recycling, from energy solutions

    - lwr fuel aqueous repro makes sense; metal fuel will likely need echem
    - aqueous has been developed for ~50 years and there are few or no unknown unknowns left
    - for echem, it is much newer and there are lots of details to figure out
    - discussed some info about how to transition from aqueous to echem as we build up a fast reactor program
    - need for echem development of safeguards and security

* Sven Bader, Industry Comments & Observations

    - need to take advantage of UNF standards
    - case study report from MRWFD (2020 plan)
    - consider integration of aqueous and echem processes (they will likely eventually be concurrent)
    - unf identification is cask systems should focus on non-self protecting, pas assembly misidentification, damaged fuel
    - they think hybrid modeling will be important for aging management program, have weird measurement angles (talk to him about this)
    - strong concern about updating fundamental data; industry does not want anything to change b/c of impact on industry past analysis.

* Vince Jodoin, Defense Land Fallout Interpretive Code (DELFIC): Application to Post-Detonation Nuclear Forensics

    - the sum of all fears
    - prompt diagnostics: diag on an unknown device, yield, yield prediction
    - urban environments, debris formation -> after things are vaporized they condense at different rates; worried about fractionation. refractory are elements that are in liquid when they solidify, volatile are in vapor 
    - debris collection: mission planning to get a quality sample, how do you know where to get a sample? how do you know if you get enough and the right materials?
    - ORIGEN fallout analysis tool
    - field analysis: dod collects sample, doe analyzes it on site and then at labs

Joel Durkee (LANL) says talk to Tom Booth.

### Day 2: 2015/03/25
* Eric Rauch, Used Fuel Cask Identification through Self-Interrogating Neutrons

    (cask fingerprinting).
    Get cask models from him?
    Can we capitalize on what he is doing?

* Cari Launiere, Advances in Molten Salt Sampling

* Natalie Gese, Actinide Sensor and Voltametry Upate

* Gregory Galbreth, Level and Density Measurement of Molten Salts

* Laura Maggos, Mass Flow Models for Electrochemical Processing Safeguards

* Howard Menlove, Optimization of a Boron Based Neutron Detector for High Radiation Fields

* Larry Ticknor, Hybrid Statistical Testing for Nuclear Material Accounting and/or Process Monitoring Data in Nuclear Safeguards

### Day 2: 2015/03/26
* Mike Rabin, Microcalorimeter Update

    Really focusing on improving counting statistics by removing systematics that prevent us getting under 1%. 
    The idea is to take advantage of newer understanding.
    Recognizing the idea that we can often measure ratios more accurately than the individual pieces. 
    Breaking that down into intra-isotope and inter-isotope information. 
    He thinks the intra values will be easier.

* Joel Ullom, Microwave Readout Techniques for Very Large Arrays of Nuclear Sensors

    - using RF squids that are helpful in cryogenic sensors. 
    - developed something new that can be used at warm temperatures.

* David Meier, The Multi-Isotope Process Monitor: Deployment at H Canyon FY 2015 Progress

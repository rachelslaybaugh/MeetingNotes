- Full application due Thursday, **Feb. 18** at 1700 Pacific

General apple pie to hit on:
- encourages new nuclear power deployment with creative solutions to the universe of nuclear energy challenges.
- NE program-related areas: Fuel Cycle Research and Development (FC R&D), Reactor Concepts Research, Development and Demonstration (RC RD&D), and Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS)

Points details:
- Program supporting: 65% technical, 35% releveance 
- Mission suporting: 80% technical, 20% relevance
- extra condiseration in relevancy for MSI (institutional level) or URG (individual level)
- program priority also important
- pre-apps get 2 relevance and 1 tech review
- tech consists of
  - sci and tech merit (35%)
  - tech quality of the proposed project (35%)
  - team capabilities, qualifications, experience, and budget (30%)

**High Relevance:** The project is fully supportive of, and has significant, easily recognized and demonstrable ties to the NE mission and the relevant workscope area. The project builds on synergies with ongoing direct funded, or competitively funded projects or meets a critical mission need. The project focuses on critical knowledge gaps where limited work is currently being performed. 

**High Program Priority:** The project is critical to program objectives and/or the workscope area
and will provide unique results that can be effectively integrated with other currently funded work (direct and/or competitively funded). 

**High Merit:** The project unquestionably advances the technical state of knowledge and understanding of the NE mission or relevant workscope area, and is creative and based largely on original concepts. The scope can be executed fully in the facilities available 


* _Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS)_
The mission of the NEAMS program is to develop and deploy the NEAMS ToolKit, comprised
of advanced computational tools, for use by government, industry, and academia in nuclear
R&D, design, and analysis. These advanced computational tools employ scalable simulation
methods on high performance computing architectures in combination with a science-based,
mechanistic approach to physics modeling to allow scientists and engineers to better understand
reactor materials properties and coupled phenomena in nuclear energy systems. The NEAMS
ToolKit spans length scales from atomic to mesoscale to continuum, and time scales from
picoseconds to seconds to days. NEAMS tools are currently being used to help evaluate
advanced nuclear fuels and reactor concepts, design and analyze nuclear fuel experiments, and
explore potential breakthroughs in the use of transient test reactors.

* _Reactor Concepts Research, Development and Demonstration (RC RD&D) Program_
The mission of the RC RD&D program is to develop new and advanced reactor designs and technologies that broaden the applicability, improve the competitiveness, and ensure the lasting contribution toward meeting our Nation’s energy and environmental challenges. Research activities are designed to address the technical, cost, safety, and security issues associated with various reactor concepts. The four technical areas are Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS), Small Modular Reactors (SMR), Advanced (Non-Light Water) Reactor Concepts and Advanced SMRs. In addition, R&D for the development and manufacturing of radioisotope and fission power systems for national security and space exploration missions is supported through the Space and Defense Power Systems Program.

### <a name="workscopes">Workscopes:
-----
Those of possible interest (repeated below in the long list):

- Advanced Safeguards Data Integration **(FC-3)**
  - Dan Vega (fed), Mike Miller (tech)
  - Advanced Safeguards Data Integration: Methods to integrate and distill data from traditional nuclear material accountancy with other data streams to achieve a higher level of awareness of nuclear material flows are being
sought. 
An example of particular interest to the Fuel Cycle Technologies R&D program is the case of electrochemical processing where integration of traditional nuclear material accountancy data (with assignable uncertainties) with advanced process monitoring (salt level and density, voltages, temperatures, etc.) is needed for near real time accountancy and process awareness. 
Such methods should keep an eye towards decreasing the Standard Error of the Inventory Difference (SEID) by innovative means of integrating data streams of relevant process data.

------------------------

- NEAMS (see pg. 75/66 for more neams description)
  - Dan Funk (fed), David Pointer (tech)
  - The NEAMS program is seeking applications that contribute to improving the mechanistic models, computational methods, and validation basis of NEAMS ToolKit and its components. 
Proposals should clearly define quantitative metrics of success for the proposed work that illustrate the return on investment (e.g., the implemented model will reduce error in predictions of peak temperature in the selected benchmark problem by X%).
  - Model development and validation can span the entire hierarchy from single-scale and single-effects experiments designed to address individual phenomena to integrated models or experiments that address strong coupling of multiple phenomena. 
Applications to run simulations or conduct experiments at DOE laboratories and [Nuclear Science User Facilities](http://atrnsuf.inl.gov/) in support of the NEAMS Toolkit are encouraged, though computation or experimentation at university laboratories is also acceptable. 
  - Collaboration with members of the NEAMS development team residing at DOE laboratories is strongly encouraged.
  - **1.3: core neutronics**
  - NEAMS’ investment in neutronics methods is driven by the need to provide much more detailed spatial and temporal descriptions of reaction rates and isotopic densities to the NEAMS fuels performance modules than can be achieved with more conventional methods. 
The NEAMS ToolKit uses the [PROTEUS](http://www.ne.anl.gov/pdfs/PROTEUSbrochure_v6.pdf) neutronics module, which provides tools for second order discrete ordinates transport, cross-section library generation, and kinetics. 
PROTEUS is integrated with ORIGEN for depletion. 
  - NEAMS also supports the development and demonstration of the [MOOSE](http://mooseframework.org/)-based [MAMMOTH](http://www5vip.inl.gov/technicalpublications/Documents/6366070.pdf) depletion application and RattleSnake transport application for assessment of transient fuel performance in the [TREAT reactor](http://www4vip.inl.gov/research/transient-reactor-test-facility/). 
  - Proposals are sought which improve predictive capabilities for complex transients, _provide capabilities for multi-resolution simulations with mixed homogenized and heterogeneous regions_, _expand and demonstrate simulation capabilities of PROTEUS to other reactor types_, extend capabilities of PROTEUS for fuel cycle analysis with a wide range of reactor core configurations, demonstrate
improved accuracy for fuel performance simulations, and improve validation basis for the codes.
  - Proposals that consider the integration of the NEAMS macroscale fuels and neutronics capabilities are also encouraged.

Slides:
- Initial motivation: How accurately can we predict local neutron reaction rates? 
- reactor product line (RPL)
- SHARP/SIGMA framework: central interoperability
- Simulation-based High-efficiency Advanced Reactor Prototyping (SHARP)
- Proteus: Can be used to analyze a fast reactor’s entire fuel cycle,
including cross section generation, radiation transport and fuel
cycle modeling; used on  ATR, ZPR,
MONJU, PHENIX, EBRII
- Validated against ZPR experiment foil reaction rates
and k-effective (more needed)
- scalability to more than 200,000 CPU
cores and billions of degrees of freedom. 

- all areas:  to improving the mechanistic models, computational
methods, and validation of NEAMS tools in the toolkit, in four areas

Tasks:
  - [8/18] Find out if MOOSE/RattleSake must go with TREAT (Rachel)
  - [after response] If so, reach out to PROTEUS team; learn about current PROTEUS capabilities (Rachel and Richard)
  - [8/18] Get webinar slides (Rachel)
  - [8/18] Ask Max and Per and Jasmina about potential overlaps / collaboration (Rachel)
  - [8/18] Contact NSUF to request info about HPC (Rachel)
  - [soon] Look into NSUF computing resources (Richard)
    - can get time at lbl; easy to get a small amount, need a real app to get real time
    - could write an incite grant to get time
    - could write nsuf to get time
  - Consider industry partner for validation data with BWRs: Westinghouse, Areva, Nagra/PSI (Rachel)
  - If PROTEUS, reach out to Todd Palmer? (Richard / Rachel)
  - Synergies: improved thermal hydraulics; improved granular flow fuel performance modeling (Richard and Rachel)
  - Talk to people in Germany (Richard)

Richard: *provide capabilities for multi-resolution simulations with mixed homogenized and heterogeneous regions*

sandra:
- core multiphysics; monte carlo and cfd
- breavrs uses openmc in mammoth within moose (neup funded in fy14 under mission supporting)
- collaborate with them? comparison with serpent? extension with their codes?
- problem: mc will take too long to converge b/c of the dominance ratio
- problems with stability and timesteps
- mc-cfd coupling is less fancy: solving part of one of these issues is where there are research spaces
- possible collab with epfl and carlo fiorino?
- casl is doing a multi-scale approach
- coupling between core neutronics and meso-scale fuel performance
- what should casl have done, but didn't try...casl as an analogy and learn from that _or_ look at these two open questions

*Proposals are sought which improve predictive capabilities for complex transients*

- sharp (proteus + origen; [neutronics], diablo [fp], Nek5000 [th]) vs. moose (RattleSNake [neutronics / Sn], mammoth [depletion], marmot [fp mesoscale], bison [fp, larger scale], barmot [combined], paragrin [lwr-specific marmot]; also many TH pieces) Mammoth is a multi-app
- sharp - likely best choice; beavrs as the benchmark study
- what does proteus actually do? 
- mc for transients is quite new; could use hybrid methods to try to speed up transiet mc full core coupled multi-physics
- can't treat delayed neutrons explicitly...vol avg'd is no longer continuous
- get broad solns from deterministic, update with mc at sharp interfaces, use fancy method to update this with timesteps
- how to map solns back and forth, getting the angle intergration to work [would cory's ldo work?]
- putting ldo into proteus to deal with this mc-sn mapping? 


Max:
- couple MC into MOOSE
- need better xsec gen in MOOSE
- 

------------------

- Integral benchmark evaluations **(MS-NE-1)**
  - Rob Versluis (fed), John Bess (tech)
  - Applications are sought to provide complete benchmark evaluations of existing experimental data that support current and future R&D activities.
  -Proposed benchmark evaluations should be of existing experimental data.
Measurements of interest include critical, subcritical, buckling, spectral characteristics, reactivity effects, reactivity coefficients, kinetics, reaction-rate and power distributions, and other miscellaneous types of neutron and gamma transport measurements. 
All evaluations must be completed according to the requirements, including peer review of the IRPhEP and the ICSBEP. 
DOE currently invests tens of millions of dollars each year to develop the next generation of nuclear engineering modeling & simulation tools. 
These tools need ad-hoc evaluated and quality assured experimental data for validation purposes and, consequently, benchmark evaluations in support of DOE programs such as, but not limited to, M&S HUB, NEAMS, LWRS, FCT and ART, and DOE activities such as resumption of transient testing, are of particular interest to this call.

------------------

- Benchmark experiments to validate multi-physics simulations for nuclear energy systems **(IRP-FC-1)** [webinar](#webinar-irp-fc-1)
  - The applicant can choose a code from the suite of codes contained in DOE-NE Software projects (MBM, SHARP, MAMMOTH, or VERA-CS) and the specific models within the code for which the experiment would serve as a benchmark over a defined range of applicability.

- Cask mis-loads evaluation techniques **(IRP-FC-2)**
  - Jc De La Garza (fed), John Scaglione (tech)
  - A technical gap identified in the Used Fuel Disposition (UFD) Storage and Transportation R&D program is the need to develop an analysis methodology to account for a potential mis-load(s) in currently loaded casks/canisters for
which burnup credit is required for transportation. 
A validated methodology for boiling water reactor (BWR) Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF) burnup credit, which is only needed for degraded, flooded conditions (e.g., transportation, HAC or disposal), is needed. 
This project will require the development of the modeling framework to assess criticality conditions in transport HAC environments, testing to provide data to benchmark the model and code, and demonstration of the model to HAC conditions.
  - tasks: innovative methodology development, proof of principle evaluation, identify and quantify inherent uncertainties, develop and implement a "mock-up" test program, prepare a detailed final report

#### <a name="webinar-irp-fc-1">IRP-FC-1: benchmark experiments to validate multi-physics simulations for nuclear energy systems
(B. P. Singh and Dave Pointer)

Presentation:
- statements of goals and objectives
- a good matrix of codes and physics and how they line up
- 6 components of a validation experiment
- consider items that contribute to uncertainty quantification
- requirements for a successful proposal
- Nuclear Energy Knowledge and Validation Center (NEKVaC)
- want info to be incorporated into a college course

Q&A:
- Q: about UQ and adjoint something something? A: Dave said that there is some space for that, but really in NEAMS - doesn't make sense in this IRP
- Q: must the codes listed be used, or can one use our own? A: Singh said need to use the ones indicated.
- Q: can this focus only on radiation damage? A: if that fits into something that makes sense here, so if it exercises multiphysics connectivity then yes. Other parts of the call focus on separate effects; this is on strongly coupled phenomena and the codes doing their multiphysics thing.
- Q: benchmarking with containment vessles? A: there's a separate thing in this call for LWR tool verification (that's the next session), so that would be more appropriate there.
- Q: info about methods and guidelines committee mentioned in FOA? A: not established yet, more info to come. 
- Q: is adding advanced materials something to the codes...? A: no, this is validating the existing codes.
- Q: is each experiment supposed to treat one specific coupling, or multiple? A: Singh: they don't really know. Dave: seen as a layered progression that provides increasing difficulty (as stated in good val experiment slide).
- Q: can analytical benchmarks be part of the V&V? A: we're looking for experiments that are new, but I supposed you could add this...

#### <a name="webinar-irp-rc-1">IRP-RC-1: validation of advanced computer models
(Rich Reister and Curtis Smith)

Presentation:
- part of light water reactor sustainability program
- went through intiatives and goals in this program
- this irp is inside risk-informed safety margin characterization (RISMC)
- RISMC tookit is RELAP-7, RAVIN, and GRIZZLY - also NEUTRINO, MASTODON
- none of those codes are neutronics...
- really searching for novel methodologies for V&V (what does that mean?)

Q&A:
- Q: interest for adjoint methods (same thing as last time). A: core physics isn't really what we're doing, so it probably won't apply much.
- Q: diff between this irp and the rc-4 -7 scopes? A: the irp is looking for new ideas, more scenarios, more codes and tools; the rcs are more small scale and existing methods.
- Q: what empirical data sets will be used? A: need info that matches the given tools - depends on specifics of proposal.
- Q: are new test facilities needed? A: use of existing data is being encourages, though you could have small new experiments if needed.
- Q: about testing. A: we can't run enough tests to really validate these codes b/c of their complexity. The point is on developing methods to validate the codes recognizing that we can't conduct all of these experiments.
- Q: not all tools need to be included in proposal. A: yes
- Q:

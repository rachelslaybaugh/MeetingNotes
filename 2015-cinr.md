### <a name="webinar">Webinar:
--------
#### <a name="webinar-irp-fc-1">IRP-FC-1: benchmark experiments to validate multi-physics simulations for nuclear energy systems
(B. P. Singh and Dave Pointer)

Presentation:
- statements of goals and objectives
- a good matrix of codes and physics and how they line up
- 6 components of a validation experiment
- consider items that contribute to uncertainty quantification
- requirements for a successful proposal
- Nuclear Energy Knowledge and Validation Center (NEKVaC)
- want info to be incorporated into a college course

Q&A:
- Q: about UQ and adjoint something something? A: Dave said that there is some space for that, but really in NEAMS - doesn't make sense in this IRP
- Q: must the codes listed be used, or can one use our own? A: Singh said need to use the ones indicated.
- Q: can this focus only on radiation damage? A: if that fits into something that makes sense here, so if it exercises multiphysics connectivity then yes. Other parts of the call focus on separate effects; this is on strongly coupled phenomena and the codes doing their multiphysics thing.
- Q: benchmarking with containment vessles? A: there's a separate thing in this call for LWR tool verification (that's the next session), so that would be more appropriate there.
- Q: info about methods and guidelines committee mentioned in FOA? A: not established yet, more info to come. 
- Q: is adding advanced materials something to the codes...? A: no, this is validating the existing codes.
- Q: is each experiment supposed to treat one specific coupling, or multiple? A: Singh: they don't really know. Dave: seen as a layered progression that provides increasing difficulty (as stated in good val experiment slide).
- Q: can analytical benchmarks be part of the V&V? A: we're looking for experiments that are new, but I supposed you could add this...

#### <a name="webinar-irp-rc-1">IRP-RC-1: validation of advanced computer models
(Rich Reister and Curtis Smith)

Presentation:
- part of light water reactor sustainability program
- went through intiatives and goals in this program
- this irp is inside risk-informed safety margin characterization (RISMC)
- RISMC tookit is RELAP-7, RAVIN, and GRIZZLY - also NEUTRINO, MASTODON
- none of those codes are neutronics...
- really searching for novel methodologies for V&V (what does that mean?)

Q&A:
- Q: interest for adjoint methods (same thing as last time). A: core physics isn't really what we're doing, so it probably won't apply much.
- Q: diff between this irp and the rc-4 -7 scopes? A: the irp is looking for new ideas, more scenarios, more codes and tools; the rcs are more small scale and existing methods.
- Q: what empirical data sets will be used? A: need info that matches the given tools - depends on specifics of proposal.
- Q: are new test facilities needed? A: use of existing data is being encourages, though you could have small new experiments if needed.
- Q: about testing. A: we can't run enough tests to really validate these codes b/c of their complexity. The point is on developing methods to validate the codes recognizing that we can't conduct all of these experiments.
- Q: not all tools need to be included in proposal. A: yes
- Q:

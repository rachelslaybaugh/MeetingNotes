#### <a name="miller">DNN Mission Needs

- look at PPD-25, PPD-33, and Prague 2009 speech (ideas in that might be
  updated). Note that Obama's view of weapon modernization has changed over
 time.
- New requirement to report continuously on TRL.
- Emergency response will stay important; nuclear test detection increasing in
  importance; weaponization detection is an area of growth.
- Role of big data nuanced and becoming more important.

#### <a name="stange">3D Processing of Something 

- 3D tomography for fast n detection (extending from 2D)
- phys modelNuclear Engineeringing capabilities; focus on fielded system
- portal modeling size for now; goal of backpack level in the long run (too low
  TRL right now).

#### <a name="jacak">Nuclear and Particle Physics

- good overview of data and projects
- collaboration opportunities perhaps in modeling for experiment design,
  expected background, etc.
- would be useful to reach out and understand what tools they use for what
- quark-gluon plasma research...

#### <a name="bernstein">Nuclear Data 

- hitting on how big of an issue nuclear data is; we get answers and we do not
  know how accurate they really are--big push for even getting error bars.
- we should go to the daf!

Concern and major issue: information is becoming flatter, but there are still
barriers to access; right next to that is bandwidth to find and parse
information; right next to that is the volume of information and being able to
sort quickly for quality. How do we find the projects + the resources + the
people and have the time and energy to map it together?


#### <a name="fratoni">Nuclear Engineering

- non-proliferant reactors by design
- MSRs are a great example
- connection of nuclear data issues for reactor design impacts; has an impact
  on safeguards--changes in material stream

#### <a name="nacht">Nuclear Security Policy

- textbook plan still moving forward, but slowly
- looking at real policy questions in light of recent events
- x-domain deterrence is another strong area of interest
- lawyer at GWU who is perhaps the foremost expert in nuclear (Emily Hammond);
  could be a very good connection for bootcamp.

Discussion: mostly about the policy matching to the labs and the summer school. 


#### <a name="czerwinski">Radiochemistry and Forensics

- radchem education as a really good way to identify students who are
  interested in these applications early
- missed part of this talk
- UNLV can ship and receive materials from DAF

#### <a name="slaybaugh">Modeling & Simulation

- interest in, across areas, looking carefully at combining experiment design
  with modeling to make sure the data really is useful. Potential to pioneer
  techniques that set the tone for experimental methods
- this is of interest also with historical data, across technical areas, and
  across institutions.

#### <a name="vetter">Nuclear Instrumentation & Radiation Detection

- lots of cool detector technologies

#### <a name="goldblum">Education and Training

- had to sneak out for other phone calls...

Randy Katz: the RISE lab: Real-time Intelligent Secure Execution

goal: live data to real-time decisions

- data is only as valuable as the decisions it enables
- faster than real time
- Spark, GraphLab, Halo, Velox, Succinct: scheduler, parallelization, memory
 access, optimization
- Ground (metadata manager)
- using cassandra, hdf5, S3, mongoDB
- looking at operations on encrypted data; don't have to decrypt to do the
  work. Wow!

Jay Zucca: Livermore Science and Technology on a Mission
(Global Security Program)
- Livermore Valley Open Campus with High-Performance Computing Innovation
  Center (HPCIC): available for collaborating with external and open work
- Strong interest in using data science to start detecting proliferation

General discussion
- very large data set hosted by LLNL for experiment and use; yahoo and amazon
  host it all now

Data Science at LLNL
- Computation research: HPC, Computational Mathematics, and Data Science
- Sierra coming in 2018; complicated architecture, have an early access system
  to try out new algorithms and ideas, esp machine learning
- analysis of multimodal data streams; predictive analytics for simulations;
  public health and machine learning for medicine (focus on cancer and public
  health records)
- non-proliferation and seismic monitoring in the nuclear world
- combination of data sets for global event detection
- good questions about accessibility of data, who can access, how can we
  access. 
- pulling open source data together and integrating it, putting unlabeled data
  with labeled data what can you infer?
- looking for like data and information...

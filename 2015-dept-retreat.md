#### <a name="chair">Chair's Report
- Need to highlight Tang Center services in light of Stan's death.
- Search for Nuclear Instrumentation position (50% FTE, JA w/ LBNL)
- Joint major with Bioengineering?
- Appointment actions in progress: S. Costas (PIR), R. Abergel (Assoc. PIR), A. Cuhna (Assoc. PIR)
- The NEPAC board did not go so smoothly, asked tough questions (need to get our finances in order if we're going to make real appeals). Report follow up
  1. Formed strategic planning committee (I'm chair)
  2. Need enhanced understanding of campus budget and financial process
  3. Innovative use of department resources and assets (noted that 1140 holds a significant footprint of inactive experimental hardware and storage). 
  4. Continued and enhanced support of national labs (esp. LANL in NSSC proposal); UCB is forming a center around High Energy Density Science with UCD, UCSD, and LLNL; forming collaboration with LANL on Mesoscale Materials Science 
  5. External fundraising
- Need new FTE request in November
- Who would like to get involved in development?
- Who wants to study and make recommendations for strategic partnerships?
- Is strategic planning going in the right direction?
- Should we pursue M. Eng. more strategically? 
  - Lee got a list of NIF opportunities; 
  - can some of that fit into M. Eng. job opportunities? 
  - What kind of career trajectories do we see for these people, and how do we make sure we're setting them up for success?


#### <a name="education">Nuclear Engineering Education
- 72 ugrads, 84 grads
- 25% grads are international
- 25% of grads are female
- 16% of ugrads are female
- 16.6% of ugrads are urep minorities (what about grad?)
- trend in increased need to fund first year grad student salaries - what's that about?
- issues with getting new students funded properly?
- GSI does not cover non-resident tuition
- TAS covers GSIs, readers, lecturers, adjuncts

NEED: we need to have a shared form where all the students and how they're funded is listed; each prof can update each year.


#### <a name="med">Medical Physics Program
UCSF side:
1. They've established a class across 2 quarters: winter and spring
- 10-week quarter + finals
- Hoping to have course be at night so that people can commute between campuses (also easier for faculty)
- Will teach at Mission Bay campus; UCB students will need to commute there
2. Additional special topics in Med. Phys. class: glorified journal club
- A meeting that is one-hour per week that can be done via videocon
3. Need lab course; still setting up those logistics 

UCB side:
- slightly expand NE 107 to meet requirements
- slightly shift NE 162 to include more rad protection
- need to add a radiobiology class: NE 290 w/ a lecturer, long term goal of NE 262. Could we build up connections with Bio E for this? (need someone to develop this course)

We need to have the courses taught once before CAMPEP will grant accreditation so they can look at student reviews of the courses (may not apply to UCB since we've taught versions of the courses already; they'll need evals from those courses). We will submit final application soon; they will send evaluators to campus.


#### <a name="manager">Dept. Manager Report
- intro of new support team (Melissa, Vicky, Debra, Christina) - need last names...
- targeted equity decoupled salary adjustments this year...
- 1.5% salary increase effective date July 1; they don't know when it will be implemented (pay will be back-dated)
- Focusing on putting together a set of resources so that new faculty know who to go to and how things happen for funding, purchasing, etc.
- space is kind of a mess
- CSS (campus shared services) assesses fees on all of our transactions
- grad division can help identify funding opportunities?


#### <a name="strategic">Strategic Planning
*convert notes*

#### <a name="research">Faculty Research Reports
Joonhong:
- funding from JAEA for crit safety of geo disp.
- KAERI funding for mat. accountancy of pyroprocessing
- resilience funded by several sources
- new funding ffrom KINAC (Korean Institute for Nuclear nonproiferation And Control)
- Research opportunities in vacuum of Yucca?

Jasmina:
- Sather, NRC (fac. dev. and fellowship), NNSA

Per:
- DOE-NE for FHR
- unsure of sources for some of these others...
- very interesting work in thermophotovoltaics (adv. tech. for power conversion)
- continued reactor design
- interesting ways to look at advanced reactor licensing

Max:
- DOE-NE for RBWR
- Gen-IV reactors (FHR, fast reactors) (not sure of funding)
- Advanced fuel cycles with Livermore
- strong desire to expand wot multi-physics for advanced reactor analysis; really looking at adding systematic assessment for uncertainty and sensitivity
- open source tools, pros and cons here 
- other reactor concepts to explore?
- mod and sim beyond energy: isotopes, medical, others?

Karl:
- PANDA (3 projects: axion, hfng, watchman)
- mostly fellows
- NSF and Heising-Smong funding
- admx-hf going well (axion thing I think)
- nnsa stockpile stewardship academic alliance center of excellence application (Jolie Cizewki, Rutgers is ending...)
- NIF pipeline
- Accelerator physics: needs to be replaced, need for this area, challenges with finding flagship projects and sources of funding.
- What is the point of the accelerator class? Is that class accomplishing that goal? Do we really want to invest there?

Lee:
- DEANS: partnering more experienced nuclear data evaluators with young researchers and scientists
- Lots of cool work and good students moving along with this
- NDNCA big success; white paper result (I completely fell down on that)
- DOE, looks like DEANS is a big win
- DTRA, NA-22, DNDO, SC-NP, USNDP, NIF
- Isotope production FOA coming up in October
- nuclear data issues: aging workforce; changing customer base (exit of NE, rise of NNSA, addition of medical)


Peter:
- DOE-NE, EPRI
- Strategic plan: user facility; direction shifting to match priorities; always a little challenging


Ed:
- writing a book
- joined other nnsa consortium, will use their accelerator if that happens and then pelletron can be converted to ion
- looking for funding for Ellen
- has been interviewed for a variety of news outlets


Rick:
- support from DOE-NE, DOE-NNSA


ABET:
- online course surveys are coming
- update course outcomes to include things like ethics, communication, professional responsbility
- idea of incorporate nuclear's role in climate change landscape

Shankar and Oscar
Karl: describing our challenges with depth of bench


Shankar: 
- omegas are going away, this will be replaced by a private-school-esque regime - 
- we will need to raise $ to get spots (target of opportunity and burden); 
- medical physics is the kind of thing we can raise a chair for...
- really need to gear up our board and working on this
- joint billets with materials since we are challenged by similar size issues?
- industrial consortia...you can have carry forward, which you can't do with federal funds
- e.g. resiliency center, get start from federal and use to get private funds (Bechtel?)

If we need 10-12, let's make the case and figure out how to get there. Put this possibility into the strategic plan (you need a pledge, we don't need it all now). Lay out the vision, the personnel needed for the vision, and use that for clear justification for fundraising.

- SMRs? 
- Breakthrough Institute looking at diseconomies of scale. Can we learn lessons from space program (NASA vs. SpaceX) and old, large, inflexible reactors compared to new SMRS.
- Nuclear waste repositories as a strategic area here, needing to maintain this in the future.
- Raising a chair in nuclear chemistry (?); wet labs at LBL. Is there industry funding for this?
- $ used to be about student credit hours, not anymore...
- Take advantage of Per's access to college relations staff for making pitches.
- Endowed chair for scientific computing in collaboration with eecs?

- Help start an NE department at the new global campus initiatives? 
- Singapore maybe not, but UAE? China: hard to get $ out.
- We could team with ppl on that (probably not now, but possibly soon).
- Could also expand course offerings to ugrad students from other countries. 
- We need gift $ up front. 
- Shanghi Tech, CAS, molten salt: could leverage those relationships and build academic programs.

- Industry is very interested in URMs and women; industry is getting very slammed here; IT is worse here; new initiatives coming out of NSF; we may be able to get involved here
- Joint major with BioE and Medical (is this expanding the pipe or just diverting the pipe?)
- The tie to pull in women could be additional justification for funds
- BioE is setting up a second joint major; it could be a good time to set up a joint major with us as well

Industry day: price tags associated with showing off what we're doing - let them know what's going on and what kind of support is needed.

- enel and edf fairly progressive (edf just aquired areva nuclear). ge is still sort of a player, but they haven't sold anything.
- Westinghouse is doing best so far
- NuScale is doing well (aquired by Fluor)
- International markets are better than domestic because of natural gas prices.


#### <a name="convos">Side Conversations
- Lee might have a way to collaborate with Sandra
- What would benchmark experiments looks like that could inform reactors and be useful for nuclear data? 
- NEAMS: adding serpent to Moose? coupled multiphysics ideas? Space for hybrid study?

- aneutronic fusion; low energy nuclear reactions (LENR)
- EM rockets
- Trump puts NASA back on the cutting edge
- spaceX looking at rtg-type surface power. Also thermal photovoltaics. 
- Tom Mueller, cofounder of spaceX--softspoken guy, very receptive of different ideas for surface power stuff (TRW, propulsion guy); he built raptor and merlin engines. He's in charge of surface power
- Dan Rasky videos
- fail fast, fail forward, surface the unknown unknowns
- there aren't fossil fuels in space, you can't use only solar, nuclear is the best option
- on station 80-90 kW total power; usually you're trying to get rid of heat b/c people and machinery produce heat. 
- confuse a way with the way
- elon has found a different way of managing risk: nasa and the navy are so afraid of failing. need to fail fast and fail safe; opportunity risk compared to failure risk
- (inability for public institutions to deal with opportunity risk over failure risk b/c of the way the public outcry would work)
- metal fuel under pressure leads to aerosoling of high-impact FPs, so we doubled down on safety equipment, and then had to make them really big to be affordable 
- diuex defense innovation unit experimental
- price spirals: sole source provider. The less you provide the more expensive it becomes, esp if it's a critical component b/c getting rid of them is hard politically, when they're not performing you just provide more resources--the alternatives are more painful for the customer
- blue origin, anteres and orbital sciences (stepping stone to disruption)
- SpaceX doesn't sole-source anything, they make it themselves. Elon didn't intend for it to be vertically integrated, thought they'd be system integration. Mars greenhouse was his original plan. So instead, he decided to build his own rocket company so he can put his greenhouse on mars. 
- cost+ contracting; the contractor gets paid regardless of what they're doing outside of criminal fraud (it's the whole mentality of now accountability or impacts)
- for him to get cost control, he could only outsource things where there are multiple providers--way low to get to where there's a functional market. He then has to do vertical integration. 

- Elon didn't know not to try; he ignored that everything was impossible and everyone told him not to. He realized that even if you don't do anything new, just bringing things up to modern practices was a huge win.
- with vertical integration has surge capacity b/c he wasn't using that much of machinery for the main product. He's been able to take over parts of markets. Incremental cost is really cheap. 
- this doesn't apply to batteries, so he's taking a different approach
- baselines everything with first order analysis of his own (physicist and economist first)
- ticket price compared to fuel price: usually 2-5, elon realized rockets was off of that by orders of magnitude. Nuclear is also a mess
- elon is very against fossil fuels. b/c solar doesn't pencil out, he may be very interested in nuclear
- dan was leo refuelling idea

- after a failure it's not just proving that you can get back to baseline on the next test, it's still leapfrogging to the next step
- Per is using Jama tracking software (?)
- intermediate loop of msre ran for 6 years without detectable corrosion
- way more tritium production than a PWR (more like a candu; need to recover it--a key technical challenge)
- spire, another company that does satellites (from international space university students who did a summer at nasa ames); started on kickstarter, got VC attention and placed in an incubator, they pivoted twice. Started with education and how they do marine traffic + weather and market how it's going for large shipping containers
- it is itself an exploration to get through the mountain range to your goal
- PIRT and CSAU (method?) developed by NRC--enabled passive safety

- treat your beta testers really well--make it prestigious. tesla warranty model
- there really is this need to normalize nuclear technology. you need to make it trendy so it's sought after and really want. turn the adoption model on it's head (e.g. tesla turned electric cars from golf carts into sexy sports cars)--everyone wants a community or neighborhood sized reactors
- can you make it a prestige play rather than a public perception barrier
- bloom energy (originally ion america), solid state (Zr electrolyte) hydrocarbon fuel cell is 65% efficient, 250 kW system. have issues with sulfur contamination (still fossil fuel)
- this isn't a technology question, it's a market question. how do you disrupt the current and very conservative industry
- ability to black start a nuclear reactor can help restart the whole grid in case of an extreme emp event
- power purchase agreement as the thing that you sell
- tight schedules and resources make the decisions easy because you have to stay focused. When you have too many resources you have lots of people who aren't really necessary, so you have to create something to keep them busy and justify their existence
- rocket labs, on a smaller scale and 3D printing their rocket (orbital)

Major challenges: Li enrichment, who makes the salt, how do you ensure the salt, how do you deal with Be handling.

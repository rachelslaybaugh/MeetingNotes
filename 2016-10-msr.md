3. New Developments for MSRs--NGOs

- need new plants to cost half
- focus on energy future scenarios with other reactor types included. Look for analysis in about a year.

Nick Smith from Southern about GAIN group activities has a good rundown of technology needs:
- access to 20% enriched HEU
- multi-physics packages from MSRs
- testing and development of advanced materials
- MSR off-gas system
- remote maintenance
- MSR ISG for NUREG--1537
- digital repo of MSR documents
- building a salt-fueled Engineering Test Facility

Jessica Lovering
- recent paper comparing reactor costs--look there for lessons learned?
- BTI study "how to make nuclear cheap"; ask about what tech breakthroughs would be the best way to make a difference here
- aircraft manufacturing as case study
- commercial space flight as second

4. Lunch talk about test reactor design was cool. Did a good job of laying out their considerations, why they made which choices, and what they're still looking to do (Lou Qualls, ORNL)

### <a name="talk-20151210"> Wenlong Zhang, Introduction of ADANES (Accelerator Driven Advanced Nuclear Energy System): 2015/12/10

- plot of relative resource utilization and radiotoxicity reduction compared to other strategies (MOX in LWR, MOX in FR, FR, B&B or C&B); ADANES better or as good as all
- high resource utilization -> breeding; high radiotoxicity reduction -> transmutation
- ADS: transmutation and breeding with high-power proton source, fuel recycle strategy required (remove FPs with high temp dry method (e.g. AIROX), remove Lns by RE extract. End up with pretty significant waste reduction
- The main motivation is extending the length of viability of NE (10,000 y they say)
- map of closed fuel cycle path; burnup fuel to 33 GWd/T
- Operation mode: use two high power linacs to produce external neutrons...I do not understand the picture. I have no idea what the R#s are
- subcritical time driven by lots of items. I wish I knew anything about how these systems work...
- There is a map of accelerator characteristics by time phase
- stuff about the accelerator
- fluidized, dense, granular target design, 
- accelerator relies on quite a bit of development -> order of magnitude larger than today.
- using gas cooled, low pressure. They started talking about reactors and I wasn't paying attention.
- triso fuel plan, though looks like also investigating rod design
- I'd be curious to learn more about these designs and what the options are...
- SIMP material is new, seems to have good properties (it is martensitic steel); corrosion testing in supercritical water
- supercomputing slide; using GPU monte carlo. need to learn about this. ask at lunch. They went very quickly through that slide.



### <a name="talk-20151012">Joseph Lassiter, III, Rethinking Nuclear, Can We Change the World's Cumulative Energy Emissions Soon Enough?: 2015/10/12

- Energy's Gordian Knot: how do you get 2 billion people out of energy + contain the environmental cost of doing so + protecting citizens from issues related to security of supply (what about economic cost?)
- He thinks U.S. data about China is more accurate the IEA, but IEA data is more accurate about U.S. than EIA.
- Juxtaposition: India cannot grow in CO2-emitting technology; China must decrease CO2-emitting technology
- thinking about predicting these changes in temperature way out doesn't include any change in behavior or (likely?) limits in the feedback mechanisms. It's so uncertain what will really happen...
- slide 9: capacity vs. production
- china: green economy for exports to oecd-type countries, brown economy internally, and brown economy for exports to lower economic countries
- China has had a radical decrease in poverty (concern about civil liberties)
- Premature death causes (!): outdoor = coal + biomass; indoor is heating and cooking fuel (can be corrected w clean energy)
- Impact shows dirty energy beats no energy; clean energy beats dirty energy from a public health perspective
- Air pollution is a rich country problem
- 1B w/out electricty; 2B w/out clean cooking fuels
- slide 19: if we mine in China or India instead of EU then the # goes up 4-5x; shortened lives also higher
- U.S. coal mining deaths are way lower
- slide 21: gas and nuclear flip based on country; but not true anymore if the capital costs aren't tamped down b/c we suck at building plants well now
- They're too expensive and too slow to build...(regulations, public perception)

Serious call to action.

- Build rxts like ships or airplanes, not like fortresses from the middle ages.
- How do we get real progress? Let people iterate their designs and have experiments (how in god's name do we do that?). We should have called this guy for the innovation summit [I need to read that executive summary].
- Where in here are the limits on source materials? Limits on building capacity? All of this stuff...
- Talk to people going to COP21...
- Seems to underestimate difficulty of regulatory hurdles for the experiment building and the technology transfer
- Some of the regulatory stuff is Secretary-level decision as opposed to law



### <a name="talk-20150504">Chris Clement, ICRP: 2015/05/04

Introduction

- ICRP since 1928 develops the system of radiological protection as the basis for standards, legislation, guidance, programs, and practice worldwide.
- Scientific Secretariat: effectively the CEO
- Committees: effects, doses, medicine, application, environment
- 218 people from 34 countries.
- last recommendations in 2007; 1991 and 1977 last before that; speedier prior to those dates.

System of Radiological Protection

- based on ethical values, science, and experience
- (top of pyramid to bottom): Primary Aim -> Protection Goals -> "Fundamental" Principles -> Concepts / Tools / Requisites
- aim: balance between protecting people and the environment and the desirable human actions associated with exposure.
- fundamental principles: do more good than harm (justification); optimization (ALARA); dose limitation 
- Very focused on fairness, minimizing risk, distributing risk fairly, etc.
- Concepts: dose, exposure situations, exposure types

Program of Work

- Have lots of ongoing publications about specific issues
- Lots of involvement with Fukushima items: initial lessons for how to improve ICRP, 18 issues and 11 recommendations.   
- Dialogue initiative: xfer experience from Chernobyl, facilitate discussions between local groups, learning for ICRP, sharing ICRP with communities.
- Lots of interesting topics; largely sensitive, complex issues
- Ethics: had been focused on traditional western ethical schools, shifting to common ideals that cut across cultures. Working towards a set of common and relevant values. 
- Idea is to explain the ethics that are behind the rp standards.

The high-foot implosion campaign on the NIF


Turning 100 m atm of pressure into 300 b atm of pressure.

1.6 MJ laser - converted to xrays, absorbed by ablator, compression makes pressure, get fusion

192 laser beams, 4 different polar angles (inner cone, outer cone) go in through laser entrance hole (LEH) into the gold hohlraum

Lawson criteria is ~25 atm-sec (pressure times time is the thing that defines this). NIF is high pressure, short time. ITER is low pressure, long time.

'Ignition' comes from when net heating from fusion outstrips net cooling from e-conduction and x-ray losses. rho-r v T curve plots region of radiation quench (too low of T with high rho-r) and conduction quench (high T w low rho-r).

Rho-r is fuel areal density. Higher rho-r increases chance of interaction (like critical mass)

Rho-r > 0.3 g/cm^2 needed for ignite; > 1 for propagation of the burn (successive regions ignite).

Burn efficiency ~ pr / (pr + 7)  [switching pr=rho-r]

Have some idealized Fermi pressure, don't get that in reality b/c higher energy and entropy, so add a correction parameter to account for that (adiabat) -> gets a pressure

Do simple 1/2 mv^2 = 3 P Vol
- need high velocity, low adiabat, small mass

Need to design shocks to keep adiabat low and velocity implosion high, and that's the goal

Low-foot campaign emphasizes lowering adiabat
High-foot (more successful) campaign is this talk.
They can now get more energy out than in, that started end of 2013.

They realized ablator material from the outside was getting too mixed in, causing more bremstrahlung radiation = too much cooling.

Low foot was 4-shock to get high velocity, low adiabat.
Making the foot higher uses up adiabat faster, meaning you need shorter time - only 3-shock implosion.

The Ethics of Technological Risk

C/B analysis is consequentialist/utilitarian, but rooted in a very specific mindset (rooted in a specific ethical theory that is highly contested) and leaves out many other concerns that are valid in ethics: justice, fairness, equity, autonomy...
Against technocratic in favor of figuring out how to incorporate values

But then also emotions

"Emotions have a bad reputation", similar to system 1 v system 2

Many people can be mapped in to 4 quads: hierarchist v egalitarian and individualist v communitarian

Moral Tribes by Goshua Greene
The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt
(rationality works post-hoc)

The Secret Joke of Kant's Soul by Greene

We're not logically inconsistent - our brains intuitively divine the moral implications of differences between choices and select the right one (you incorporate other values such as autonomy, fairness, etc.)

Moral emotions and intuitions, Sabine Roeser

Emotions and risky technologies, Sabine Roeser
the kite runner

Intersection of arts and emotions and developing emotional understand around risky technology


Thought exercise: go through with people: what are your goals? How do we get there?

### <a name="talk-20140310">Cameron Geddes, LBNL: 2014/03/10

Transportable MeV photon probe important to detection and characterization of nuclear material.

Can increase resolution; need transportable sources
penetration depth sets base photon need. 10^10 photons

Photofission 5-20 MeV, maybe even 10^11 photons.
Need narrow energy emission.
Nuclear resonance fluorescence is the gold standard, need good resolution.

How do they make photons: Thomspon scattering. Get 0.3-1 GeV electrons from lasers Frequency doubled laser: 0.2-0.7 GeV. They're working on laser plasma accelerators to meet these needs.

Femto-s laser ionizes a plasma, accelerates the particle (plasma wave structure causes acceleration). Pondermotive force + plasma oscillation (get harmonic oscillator) -> get wave propagation that can accelerate electrons.

Control is highly required, so we need to make sure we have good laser control.

Have the ability to predict this somewhat easily - and you can also learn about laser guiding.

Laser front control with deformable mirror. Fluctuations tuned by jet contour. Now getting > 200 MeV at 10 TW. Still issues with self-trapping tuning. Close to theory, but still having control problems.

Can control by changing initial particle velocity or by modulating wake velocity.

Big issues with power limitations.

## <a name="talk-20150504">Chris Clement, ICRP: 2015/05/04

- ICRP since 1928 develops the system of radiologica protectoin as the basis for standards, legislation, guidance, programmes, and practice worldwide.
- Scientific Secretariat: effectively the CEO
- Committees: effects, doses, medicine, application, environment
- 218 people from 34 countries.
- last recommendations in 2007; 1991 and 1977 last before that; speedier prior to those dates.

transportable MeV photon probe important to detection and characterization of nuclear material.

can increase resolution; need transportable sources
penetration depth sets base photon need. 10^10 photons

photofission 5-20 MeV, maybe even 10^11 photons.
need narrom energy emission.
Nuclear resonance fluoreschence is the gold standard, need good resolution.

How do they make photons: thomspon scattering. get 0.3-1 GeV electrons from lasers Frequency doubled laser: 0.2-0.7 GeV. They're working on laser plasma accelerators to meet these needs.

femto-s laser ionizes a plasma, accelerates the particle (plasma wave structure causes acceleration). Pondermotive force + plasma oscillation (get harmonic oscillater) -> get wave propagation that can accelerate electrons.

control is highly required, so we need to make sure we have good laser control.

Have the ability to predict this somewhat easily - and you can also learn about laser guiding.

laser front control with deformable mirror. fluctuations tuned by jet contour. now getting > 200 MeV at 10 TW. Still issues with self-trapping tuning. close to theory, but still having control problems.

can control by changing initial particle velocity or by modulating wake velocity.

big issues with power limitations.

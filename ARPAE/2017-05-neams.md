### <a name="open">Opening
- Chris Stanek talked a bit about the political context
- Brad gave a NEAMS overview--focusing on laptop simulation through leadership
  class computers; good sense of reality of the context they're operating in.
- the very great codes can be hard to use; so they're making the IPL
- NEAMS has Fuel Product Line (FPL) and Reactors Product Line (RPL), and both
  are hard to use.
- Working to make these easier to use; use high-fidelity simulation to inform
  low-order design tools
- Integrating MOOSE and the ANL codes (PROTEUS, SIGMA, and NEK5000); Warthog
  multiphysics coupling is the thing doing that. 
- DTK will also get brought in here (which, hopefully, will facilitate the long
  term integration of CASL tools as needed)
- I think we need to pay attention to what enables more things to talk to one
  another vs. ending up with only one tool to do each thing (flexibility vs.
  independence vs. redundance)
- NEAMS IPL supports NEUP and SBIR ($150k for phase I and $1M for phase II); looking to make that better

### <a name="time res"> High‐Resolution Time‐Resolved Experiments on Mixing and
Entrainment of Buoyant Jets in Stratified Environments; Annalisa Manera &
Philippe Bardet
- RANS models over-predict stratification
- LES is likely to be better; need experimental validation to be able to improve
  local predictions
- measuring velocity and density; working to do UQ
- modeling of ternary systems are not well known; excess properties behave
  differently. Looking at measuring these things. Hard to design experiments.
- H2O - Glycerol - 1 Propanol to do proof of principle. 
- the punchline is that you get these density jets; need to have refractive
  index matching for making measurements (I think)
- next up: buoyant jets
- good sets of experimental expertise

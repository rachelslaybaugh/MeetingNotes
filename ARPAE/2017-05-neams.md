*May 30*

### <a name="open">Opening
- Chris Stanek talked a bit about the political context
- Brad gave a NEAMS overview--focusing on laptop simulation through leadership
  class computers; good sense of reality of the context they're operating in.
- the very great codes can be hard to use; so they're making the IPL
- NEAMS has Fuel Product Line (FPL) and Reactors Product Line (RPL), and both
  are hard to use.
- Working to make these easier to use; use high-fidelity simulation to inform
  low-order design tools
- Integrating MOOSE and the ANL codes (PROTEUS, SIGMA, and NEK5000); Warthog
  multiphysics coupling is the thing doing that. 
- DTK will also get brought in here (which, hopefully, will facilitate the long
  term integration of CASL tools as needed)
- I think we need to pay attention to what enables more things to talk to one
  another vs. ending up with only one tool to do each thing (flexibility vs.
  independence vs. redundance)
- NEAMS IPL supports NEUP and SBIR ($150k for phase I and $1M for phase II); looking to make that better

### <a name="time"> High‐Resolution Time‐Resolved Experiments on Mixing and
Entrainment of Buoyant Jets in Stratified Environments; Annalisa Manera &
Philippe Bardet
- RANS models over-predict stratification
- LES is likely to be better; need experimental validation to be able to improve
  local predictions
- measuring velocity and density; working to do UQ
- modeling of ternary systems are not well known; excess properties behave
  differently. Looking at measuring these things. Hard to design experiments.
- H2O - Glycerol - 1 Propanol to do proof of principle. 
- the punchline is that you get these density jets; need to have refractive
  index matching for making measurements (I think)
- next up: buoyant jets
- good sets of experimental expertise

### <a name="uo2"> Experimental Validation of UO2 Microstructural Evolutions for
NEAMS Tool MARMOT; Yong Yang

(note: presented remotely, a bit hard to see slides) 
- performing experiments to validate grain boundary (GB) migration and GB/pore
  interaction in UO2. Comparing to MARMOT.
- need to understand microstructure for thermal behavior, fission gas release,
  PCI, swelling, etc.
- measuring grain size using ImageJ software (following ASTM E112 stanard)
- grain growth can be calculated with theoretical models; they're looking to
  confirm and to measure the properties that go into those equations.
- adding experimental microstructure data to MARMOT did better matching than
  using Voronoi microstructure as the starting point
- However, MARMOT definiteley isn't right. MARMOT doesn't capture as much growth
  as the experiment found--it's really underestimated.
- Anisotropy is also an issue; did electron backscatter to look into this 
- also looked at grain mobility
- MARMOT predicts slightly lower tilt GB energies, but does pretty well--works
  well for GBs with high symmetry. It doesn't do as well with GBs with low
  symmetry.
- Looking at 3D approaches for the future. Also looking for correlation between
  misorientation angle and annealing to incorporate into MD.

### <a name="nano">Integrated Nanomechanical Raman Spectroscopy and TEM Based
Experimental Data in MOOSE Framework; Vikas Tomar
- looking also at GB, void formation, etc. for cladding
- looking at multiphysical property datasets of nuclear materials based on
  in-situ observations and measurements
- Used FEM comparisons with experiment. 
- MARMOT is easier than BISON to use I think.
(seems like it would be good to get these slides;  I basically didn't pay attention)

### <a name="accel">Current Developments in Acceleration Schemes for Neutron
Transport Calculations; Dean Wang
- Galerkin methods based diffusion acceleration schemes in PROTEUS (with Yulong
  Xing (OSU), Tom Downar and Yunlin Xu (Mich), and Emily Shemon (ANL))
- started in MATLAB and then went to PROTEUS
- building up from SN 1D/2D through DG-DSA
- looking at NDA (nonlinear diffusion acceleration) and linear DSA
- use drift coefficient to deal with differences between DE and TE solution
  spaces; should have the same local balance when TE converged.
- stability issues: CMFD, pCMFD, odCMFD
- local refinement (LR)-NDA is their new thing. There's a fine mesh, a coarse mesh, and a local
  mesh. The local mesh is some other mesh where the solve a local boundary
  problem. Do this to get very fine scalar flux? They do fine mesh transport
  sweep, CMFD, and NDA on local refinement areas. I think?
- works well for 1D k-eigenvalue
- overall this seemed to be better than all versions of CMFD; didn't completely
  understand what this new method is doing. Interested in see a paper about this
  so I can see what's really going on.
- They do local refinement in coarse cells at some locations only, I think. They
  can parallelize the LR areas as they're all independent of one another (since
  they're BVPs) 
- they also looked at DSA: works well in 1D, not great in 2D, issues with
  discretization consistency; works well on fxd src. 
- Galerkin DSA: solve DSA on coarse mesh using DG; get local hp adaptivity and
  can parallelize b/c of local compactness

He has a list of references; perhaps from his website?

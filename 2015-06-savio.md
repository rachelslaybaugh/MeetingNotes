- Each piece of software is managed by one person
- That person tells Krishna who needs to be in the associated group
- there is a top level group directory for nuclear condo
- We do installation in a software specific folder so that only a group has access to that folder

- evaluate if a given application really needs to be shared compared to an individual person
- criteria: 
  - how many people will need access?
  - how large is the software?

- we can have a general bin/share/lib

- Keep shared spreadsheet up to date; anytime we change it, email Krishna

- we create the folder and change the group setting

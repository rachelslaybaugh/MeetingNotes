### <a name="day-20160607">Day 1: 2016/06/07 

* "Bayesian Metropolis"..., Hite and Schmidt (NC State);
  About Bayseian modeling for source in building, uses Metropolis
  teqhniques for source localization. Seems to be working pretty well.
  Mattingly is one of the relevant advisors. NC State students.

* "Cooperative Search"... Meyer (NC State); didn't pay attention

* "A Big Data Pipeline"... Christe (U Hawaii);
  Cool use of cell phones to record vibration signatures for explosion
  detection.

* "Full-Motion Virtual Reality"... Patton (Princeton);
  Also didn't really pay attention; using VR to see what things are possible to
  detect, have in a space, etc.

* "Volumetric Gamma-Ray"... Barnowski (UCB);
  Missed most of it; very cool results of their radiation image mapping

* "Modifcation of NIF"... Bevins (UCB);
  Good job!

* Mattingly: looks like CNEC is doing contributory work

* Clair Sullivan: doing really cool work. Think more carefully about
  statistics. Talk to her about amazon and how amazon is being used in her
  research group...

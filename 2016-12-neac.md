Nothing new from last night.

#### <a name="nsuf">Assessment of user needs for irradiation testing
- report is not yet completed; need comments for recommendations; seems like a
  lot of information in there...
- some reactors already have replaceable components, which allows them to have
  an "unlimited" lifetime
- slide 6 has good summary of current irradiation facilities
- *no capability for fast spectrum testing; can't test irradiation fuels in
  systems that represent liquid-metal or salt reactors either*
**arpa-e:** how do you qualify fuel without needing these facilities? There's a
need and request for it. Same need for materials damage irradiations.
- instrumentation is also a problem
- there are international fast reactors: JOYO, BOR-60 (sort of RJH). If the
  fast flux isn't high enough, it takes waaaaay too long to test. 
- and across the board, all of the reactors are old
- slide 9 has partial list of capability; 10 has plans for what's new 
- error: china doesn't have plans to add another SFR test reactor
- U.S. irradiation needs: 12 is what a bunch of people think--need lots of
  things. A major question: can anything be done in a timeframe to make a
  difference? Maybe not, so they're making other plans. However, will be useful
  for the long run either way.
- international identified similar needs to the industry group; slightly more
  specific. 
**arpa-e**: advanced real time instrumentation
- potential for engaging with Russia and India to use their test reactors...
- Burt on the phone: bureaucratic nightmare of doing things with nuclear
  materials outside of the U.S., esp for small companies. Can DOE take
  responsibility for getting these things through.
- weapons: had a need for a transformational technical approach that was
  inspired by the CTBT; is climate change our similar motivation? Can we do
  this? Can we get a nuclear reactor ASCI program?
- Ask Tom about the NEST thing...
- Make sure to consider the long-term impact of a test facility. It isn't just
  to get things licensed. Plan for decades of development and answering
  questions.
- I said: think about cost; point is that the ASCI program has really driven a
  need for better data, that requires experiments and comes with its own
  challenges.
- point that getting into test facilities is not trivial. 
- thoughts about the role of people and education in all of this; note: Halden
  doesn't have enough customers and has to shut down.
- we really need to make sure a robust customer base so if we build one of
  these things we actually use it.
- na-20 report about what to do for safeguards. Need for talent. Lots of the
  same things. Can we double up by focusing also on what's needed from a
  national security point of view.
- test reactor vs. demo. Should the report deal with that head on? Not
  budgetarily, but what can you do with a prototype vs. a full test.
- test reactor is a national capability that will be operating for decades; a
  prototype really needs a demand pull for it to make any sense.

#### <a name="waste">Spent fuel & waste disposition update
- good slides about what waste management looks like and where it's stored: 5
  and 6
> “There is a role for non-technical people in technical
> decision-making, and it should not be underestimated. It’s
> not easy. It’s not straight-line decision-making, and
> requires a significant amount of education, commitment
> and listening.”
- now have a new railcar that can deal with the heaviest casks in the U.S.
- RFI on how private companies can play a role on consolidated interim storage
  facilities
- looking at how to make an interim storage facility to work in terms of
  logistics.
- *looking at how to bring idea of environmental justice as part of the
  program.*

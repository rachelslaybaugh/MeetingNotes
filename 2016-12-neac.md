#### <a name="intro">Introduction
Nothing new from last night.

[Agenda](#top)


#### <a name="nsuf">Assessment of user needs for irradiation testing
- report is not yet completed; need comments for recommendations; seems like a
  lot of information in there...
- some reactors already have replaceable components, which allows them to have
  an "unlimited" lifetime
- slide 6 has good summary of current irradiation facilities
- *no capability for fast spectrum testing; can't test irradiation fuels in
  systems that represent liquid-metal or salt reactors either*
- **arpa-e:** how do you qualify fuel without needing these facilities? There's a
need and request for it. Same need for materials damage irradiations.
- instrumentation is also a problem
- there are international fast reactors: JOYO, BOR-60 (sort of RJH). If the
  fast flux isn't high enough, it takes waaaaay too long to test. 
- and across the board, all of the reactors are old
- slide 9 has partial list of capability; 10 has plans for what's new 
- error: china doesn't have plans to add another SFR test reactor
- U.S. irradiation needs: 12 is what a bunch of people think--need lots of
  things. A major question: can anything be done in a timeframe to make a
  difference? Maybe not, so they're making other plans. However, will be useful
  for the long run either way.
- international identified similar needs to the industry group; slightly more
  specific. 
- **arpa-e**: advanced real time instrumentation
- potential for engaging with Russia and India to use their test reactors...
- Burt on the phone: bureaucratic nightmare of doing things with nuclear
  materials outside of the U.S., esp for small companies. Can DOE take
  responsibility for getting these things through.
- weapons: had a need for a transformational technical approach that was
  inspired by the CTBT; is climate change our similar motivation? Can we do
  this? Can we get a nuclear reactor ASCI program?
- Ask Tom about the NEST thing...
- Make sure to consider the long-term impact of a test facility. It isn't just
  to get things licensed. Plan for decades of development and answering
  questions.
- I said: think about cost; point is that the ASCI program has really driven a
  need for better data, that requires experiments and comes with its own
  challenges.
- point that getting into test facilities is not trivial. 
- thoughts about the role of people and education in all of this; note: Halden
  doesn't have enough customers and has to shut down.
- we really need to make sure a robust customer base so if we build one of
  these things we actually use it.
- na-20 report about what to do for safeguards. Need for talent. Lots of the
  same things. Can we double up by focusing also on what's needed from a
  national security point of view.
- test reactor vs. demo. Should the report deal with that head on? Not
  budgetarily, but what can you do with a prototype vs. a full test.
- test reactor is a national capability that will be operating for decades; a
  prototype really needs a demand pull for it to make any sense.

#### <a name="waste">Spent fuel & waste disposition update
- good slides about what waste management looks like and where it's stored: 5
  and 6

> “There is a role for non-technical people in technical
> decision-making, and it should not be underestimated. It’s
> not easy. It’s not straight-line decision-making, and
> requires a significant amount of education, commitment
> and listening.”

- now have a new railcar that can deal with the heaviest casks in the U.S.
- RFI on how private companies can play a role on consolidated interim storage
  facilities
- looking at how to make an interim storage facility to work in terms of
  logistics.
- *looking at how to bring idea of environmental justice as part of the
  program.*
- RFP for borehole disposal study.
- Do we really need a waste program? There is a discussion that exists when
  people has been assuming that this is needed... How do we describe the
  compelling need of what needs to be done?
- best ever: My Fair Lady was just quoted

#### <a name="gain">GAIN
> Those who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it.

- Safety brief. OMG she is fantastic.
- NEAC didn't know what GAIN is. *Facepalm*.
- NRC has been very collaborative with GAIN.

> Change is the law of life. Those who look only to the past and present are
> certain to miss the future.
>    - JFK

> There is no innovation and creativity with failure. Period.
>    - Brene Brown

- fail fast, fail small, fail forward.
- org chart slide 6
- GAIN not just advanced reactors; is advanced nuclear technologies.
- consider getting reports from the technology workshops (MSR, HTGR, FR)
- If nothing else, these are groups I can interface with. Also, EPRI M&S
  workshop next week.	
- NEI Adv. Rxtr. working group meeting next week as well.
- **arpa-e**: slides 14-18 on needs across technologies and for each technology
- AT (applied technology) documents is a DOE designator.
- NRC requested $5M to begin getting ready for SMR license review.
- Good Q: how can be use what GAIN is doing to incorporate with international
  focus? May be ways to coordinate gap / needs considerations.
- Interested in how the management is working for the voucher program. 1 year
  programs; how closely are they managed? How accountable is it?
- GAIN will issue a collective press release of results. Encouragement to let
  people promote what they've done as soon as possible. 
- NSUF is part of what GAIN can access, which does include universities.

#### <a name="inl1">Making INL a World Class National Laboratory
- need for stronger international engagement with the global community.
- also need stronger understanding from within industry of what is available
  through INL; desire for partnership, not just a job shop.
- NSUF is important to broaden and internationalize.
- GAIN is another great opportunity, expand industry collaboration. 
- GAIN is also a vehicle for knowledge transfer of what has been done since
  lots of these researchers may not know. Help avoid wasted time and money.
- INL is doing good research in Idaho, particular interest with cybersecurity
  (see awesome grid in the desert). However, problems with delays in cleanup of
  past items, esp. Rocky Flats stuff.
- recommendations to deal with that is pretty good, esp. expand CAES.
- there's a lot of interest from previously opposed groups to develop
  emissions-free sources like nuclear. Could be partners in the future. Need to
  leverage this interest. 
- get rid of the useless interactions with DOE :)
- great growth into security and clean energy development. Real opportunity to
  grow with and have a strong impact on culture and optics.
- How do you get the best and the brightest to go to INL? What can you really
  do to get innovators there? Such great opportunity, and so out of sync with
  the values of today's students. May take something.
- We need to work more closely with EERE (INL and NREL should strengthen
  relationships and collaborations. (Kammen-Slaybaugh as an example?)
- Point that world class labs are often partnered with world class
  universities. I'm not sure how accurate that actually is in the U.S. Actually,
  I think it's not. Huh.

#### <a name="inl2">INL Plan
- Position INL to be *relevant* to tomorrow's energy future. Why not a leader
  in tomorrow's energy future?
- 20% of budget from NNSA, 1/2 from NE, lots of classified work, growing amount
  of EERE. A bit over $1B budget.
- maybe also be prepared that retention might look different if you want really
  dynamic and talented people. This is a millenial truism, but consider
  embracing and preparing for it. 
- Increasing LDRD funding; moving from 3.1% up to 4.0% over next 5 years.
  Perhaps room after that.
- Implicit Bias interruption training program
- NREL program on how nuclear and renewables integrate: hybrid energy systems
  (already collaborative with EERE; lots of synergies there). Shannon
  Bragg-Sitton is someone I should probably talk with about that.

#### <a name="international">Opportunities to Internationalize NSUF
- Need more data before anything comprehensive and really be done. 

[Agenda](#top)


#### <a name="comments">
- new test reactor will require new types of multi-dimensional analysis because
  of the scales of what may be involved.
- we can re-think our approach, PRA as an integrated approach to begin with
- enterprise modeling and simulation can be used to look at funding and funding
  models; ease of use of materials from a non-pro sense, etc. Do scenario
  modeling; incorporate operating experience knowledge, etc.

NEAC comments:
- big focus on actually build something. Do it on time. Do it on budget. Just
  get moving.
- Also a general sense of optimism.
- Really give a sense of high-importance--people will do a lot for this.
- (note from me: need to rethink accountability and philosophy. It is unlikely
  that large, bloated institutions are really going to be agile. See lots and
  lots of examples. How to overcome that challenge?)
- There might be a chance for a significant change in waste management policy;
  please act quickly and decisively in this window.
- consent-based siting + humans ability to perceive risk. Voluntary vs.
  involuntary risk as a key factor here that is an opportunity. 
- Failure to really think about the economic case. 
- Climate change is not going to be a driver, so we need a compelling case for
  nuclear (economic! air pollution in general! grid stability, security,
  safety, etc. Lots that can be made)

[Agenda](#top)

*thought*: the idea that mod & sim is faster than experiments is no longer
accurate. E.g. it took 1.5 years to get access to "cutting edge" software. It
has taken more than 6 months to get a functional input file. That input file
won't actually do the thing the customer wants. I've had to get custom code
modifications, apply for supercomputing time, and do an unending amount of
paperwork, emailing, phone calls, and interfacing. We have still not been able
to run a single calculation.
